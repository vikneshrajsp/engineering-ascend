## 📋 Overview
Data storage systems form the foundational layer of distributed systems architecture. This handbook provides rigorous technical analysis of storage systems, their internal mechanisms, consistency guarantees, and scaling patterns. Understanding these fundamentals is essential for making informed architectural decisions in large-scale distributed systems.

### **What is a Distributed System?**
A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appears to users as a single coherent system. These systems are designed to handle large-scale data processing, provide high availability, and achieve fault tolerance through redundancy and replication.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle increased load by adding more resources
- **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating despite component failures
- **Consistency**: Data remains consistent across all nodes
- **Availability**: System remains accessible even during failures

### **Why Storage Systems Matter**
Storage systems are the backbone of any distributed application. They determine:
- **Performance**: How fast data can be read/written
- **Reliability**: How well data is protected from loss
- **Scalability**: How the system grows with data volume
- **Cost**: Total cost of ownership including hardware, maintenance, and operations

### **Storage System Design Principles**
1. **CAP Theorem**: Choose two out of three - Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance
2. **ACID Properties**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability for transactions
3. **Eventual Consistency**: Data becomes consistent over time in distributed systems
4. **Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling**: Scale out vs scale up approaches
5. **Data Locality**: Keep data close to where it's processed

## 🏗️ Storage System Classifications

### 1. **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)**

#### **Historical Context & Design Philosophy**
RDBMS emerged in the 1970s to solve the fundamental problem of **data consistency and integrity** in business applications. The primary goal was to eliminate data redundancy and ensure that business rules could be enforced at the database level.

**Why RDBMS Was Established:**
- **Data Integrity Crisis**: Early file systems suffered from data duplication, inconsistency, and integrity violations
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Need to ensure referential integrity (e.g., orders must reference valid customers)
- **Transaction Safety**: Financial and business operations required atomic, consistent operations
- **Ad-hoc Querying**: Business users needed flexible querying capabilities without predefined access paths

**Core Design Philosophy:**
RDBMS optimizes for **read-heavy workloads with complex queries** while maintaining strong consistency. The design assumes that:
- Data relationships are as important as the data itself
- Complex analytical queries are common
- Data integrity is more important than raw performance
- Storage cost is secondary to query flexibility

#### **Core Characteristics**
- **ACID Properties**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- **Structured Data**: Predefined schemas with relational constraints
- **SQL Language**: Standardized query and manipulation language
- **Transaction Support**: ACID-compliant transaction processing with isolation levels

#### **Data Structure Optimization Strategy**
RDBMS employs a **multi-layered optimization approach** that balances query performance with data integrity:

**1. B-Tree/B+ Tree Optimization:**
- **Why B-Trees**: Traditional binary trees become unbalanced with sequential inserts, leading to O(n) worst-case performance
- **B-Tree Solution**: Self-balancing structure ensures O(log n) performance regardless of insertion order
- **Disk Optimization**: Node sizes match disk block sizes (4KB-16KB) to minimize I/O operations
- **Range Query Optimization**: B+ trees link leaf nodes for efficient sequential access

**2. Buffer Pool Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Disk I/O is 100,000x slower than memory access
- **Solution**: Keep frequently accessed pages in memory buffer pool
- **LRU Eviction**: Least Recently Used pages are evicted when buffer is full
- **Dirty Page Management**: Modified pages are written back to disk asynchronously

**3. Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):**
- **Problem**: System crashes could lose uncommitted transactions
- **Solution**: Log all changes before applying them to data structures
- **Crash Recovery**: Replay log to restore consistent state
- **Performance Impact**: Sequential writes to log are much faster than random writes to data files

#### **Internal Data Structures**

##### **B-Tree Indexes**
```
                    [Root Node]
                    /     |     \
                   /      |      \
              [Leaf]   [Leaf]   [Leaf]
              /  |  \   /  |  \   /  |  \
             /   |   \ /   |   \ /   |   \
           [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
```

**B-Tree Properties:**
- **Balanced Structure**: All leaf nodes at same level, O(log n) height
- **Ordered Keys**: Keys sorted within each node for efficient range queries
- **Disk-Optimized**: Designed for block-based storage with configurable fanout
- **Concurrent Access**: B-link trees support concurrent modifications

**Deep Optimization Details:**
- **Node Size Optimization**: 4KB-16KB nodes match disk block sizes, minimizing I/O operations
- **Fanout Calculation**: Optimal fanout = block_size / (key_size + pointer_size), typically 100-1000
- **Height Minimization**: With fanout of 1000, a B-tree with 1 billion records has height of only 3
- **Split Strategy**: 50/50 split ensures balanced distribution and prevents cascading splits
- **Locking Granularity**: Intent locks prevent phantom reads, row-level locks enable high concurrency

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **Search Complexity**: O(log n) with base = fanout (typically 100-1000)
- **Insert/Delete**: O(log n) with potential rebalancing
- **Range Queries**: O(log n + k) where k is number of results
- **Space Utilization**: 50-100% node utilization (varies by implementation)

##### **B+ Tree Indexes**
```
                    [Root Node]
                    /     |     \
                   /      |      \
              [Leaf]   [Leaf]   [Leaf]
              /  |  \   /  |  \   /  |  \
             /   |   \ /   |   \ /   |   \
           [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
           v   v   v   v   v   v   v   v   v
         [Data][Data][Data][Data][Data][Data][Data][Data][Data]
```

**B+ Tree Advantages:**
- **All Data in Leaves**: Internal nodes contain only keys, reducing tree height
- **Sequential Access**: Leaf nodes linked for efficient range scans
- **Better for Range Queries**: O(log n + k) for k results in range
- **Reduced Tree Height**: More keys per internal node, fewer disk accesses

**Deep Optimization Details:**
- **Memory Efficiency**: Internal nodes fit more keys (no data pointers), reducing tree height by 1-2 levels
- **Sequential I/O Optimization**: Linked leaf nodes enable efficient range scans without random disk seeks
- **Cache Locality**: Internal nodes stay in memory longer due to smaller size
- **Bulk Operations**: Range deletes/updates can traverse leaf chain efficiently
- **Compression Opportunities**: Internal nodes can use prefix compression for similar keys

**Performance Impact:**
- **Tree Height Reduction**: 20-40% reduction in tree height compared to B-trees
- **Range Query Speed**: 2-5x faster for large ranges due to sequential access
- **Memory Usage**: 30-50% less memory for internal nodes
- **Insert Performance**: Slightly slower due to leaf node management overhead

##### **Skiplist Data Structures**
```
Level 3: [Head] ---------------------------> [Tail]
Level 2: [Head] -----------> [Node] ------> [Tail]
Level 1: [Head] --> [Node] -> [Node] -----> [Tail]
Level 0: [Head] -> [Node] -> [Node] -> [Node] -> [Tail]
```

##### **LSM Trees (Log-Structured Merge Trees)**
```
LSM Tree Architecture:
Level 0: [MemTable] (in-memory, sorted)
Level 1: [SSTable1] [SSTable2] [SSTable3] (small, overlapping)
Level 2: [Merged SSTable4] [Merged SSTable5] (larger, sorted)

- **Cassandra**: Uses LSM trees for storage
- **HBase**: Uses LSM trees for data storage

##### **Inverted Indexes**
```
Inverted Index Structure:
Term Dictionary: [term1] [term2] [term3] [term4]
Posting Lists: [doc1,pos1] [doc2,pos2] [doc3,pos3] [doc4,pos4]
```

**Inverted Index Properties:**

- **Aggregation Support**: Built-in analytics capabilities

#### **ACID Transaction Properties Explained**

##### **Atomicity - "All or Nothing"**
**Definition**: Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit. Either all operations within the transaction succeed, or none of them do. If any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to its initial state.

**Real-World Example**:
```
Bank Transfer Transaction:
Before: Account A = $500, Account B = $300

Transaction Steps:
1. Debit Account A: $500 - $100 = $400
2. Credit Account B: $300 + $100 = $400

Success Case: Both operations succeed
- Account A = $400, Account B = $400 ✓

Failure Case: Step 2 fails
- Account A = $400 (temporary)
- Account B = $300 (unchanged)
- System detects failure and rolls back
- Account A = $500 (restored), Account B = $300 ✓
```

**Implementation Details**:
- **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**: All changes are logged before being applied
- **Undo Records**: Store original values for rollback capability
- **Redo Records**: Store new values for recovery after crashes
- **Two-Phase Commit**: Prepare phase and commit phase for distributed transactions

**Why It Matters**: Prevents partial updates that could leave the system in an inconsistent state. Critical for financial systems, inventory management, and any application where data integrity is paramount.

##### **Consistency - "Data Integrity"**
**Definition**: Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another. All constraints, triggers, and business rules must be satisfied before and after the transaction.

**Types of Consistency**:
1. **Entity Integrity**: Primary keys are unique and not null
2. **Referential Integrity**: Foreign keys reference valid primary keys
3. **Domain Integrity**: Data types and constraints are enforced
4. **Business Rule Integrity**: Custom business logic is maintained

**Real-World Example**:
```
User Registration System:
Constraints:
- Email must be unique
- Password must be at least 8 characters
- Age must be >= 18

Valid Transaction:
- Email: "john@example.com" (unique)
- Password: "secure123" (8+ characters)
- Age: 25 (>= 18)
Result: Transaction succeeds ✓

Invalid Transaction:
- Email: "john@example.com" (already exists)
- Password: "secure123" (8+ characters)
- Age: 25 (>= 18)
Result: Transaction fails, no data inserted ✓
```

**Implementation Details**:
- **Constraint Checking**: Database validates all constraints before commit
- **Trigger Execution**: Custom business logic runs during transaction
- **Validation Rules**: Application-level and database-level validation
- **Rollback on Violation**: Transaction aborts if any constraint is violated

**Why It Matters**: Ensures data quality and prevents invalid data from corrupting the system. Essential for maintaining data integrity across all applications.

##### **Isolation - "Concurrent Access Control"**
**Definition**: Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Each transaction appears to be executed in isolation, even when multiple transactions are running simultaneously.

**Concurrency Anomalies**:
1. **Dirty Read**: Reading uncommitted data from another transaction
2. **Non-Repeatable Read**: Same query returns different results within a transaction
3. **Phantom Read**: Same query returns different number of rows within a transaction
4. **Lost Update**: Two transactions update the same data, one overwrites the other

**Isolation Levels Explained**:

**Read Uncommitted (Level 0)**:
- **Allows**: All concurrency anomalies
- **Performance**: Highest performance
- **Use Case**: Reporting where absolute accuracy isn't critical
- **Example**: Analytics dashboard showing approximate counts

**Read Committed (Level 1)**:
- **Prevents**: Dirty reads
- **Allows**: Non-repeatable reads, phantom reads
- **Performance**: Good balance
- **Use Case**: Most business applications
- **Example**: E-commerce product catalog

**Repeatable Read (Level 2)**:
- **Prevents**: Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads
- **Allows**: Phantom reads
- **Performance**: Moderate impact
- **Use Case**: Financial applications
- **Example**: Bank account balance checking

**Serializable (Level 3)**:
- **Prevents**: All concurrency anomalies
- **Performance**: Highest consistency, lowest performance
- **Use Case**: Critical financial transactions
- **Example**: Stock trading, inventory management

**Implementation Details**:
- **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**: Each transaction sees a snapshot of data
- **Locking Mechanisms**: Row-level, table-level, and intent locks
- **Deadlock Detection**: Automatic detection and resolution of deadlocks
- **Version Chains**: Multiple versions of data for concurrent access

**Real-World Example**:
```
Flight Booking System:
Scenario: Two users booking the same seat

User A Transaction:
1. Check seat availability: Seat 15A available
2. Book seat 15A
3. Commit transaction

User B Transaction (concurrent):
1. Check seat availability: Seat 15A available (dirty read if isolation not enforced)
2. Book seat 15A
3. Commit transaction

With Proper Isolation:
- User A's transaction completes first
- User B's transaction fails with "seat already booked"
- No double-booking occurs ✓
```

**Why It Matters**: Prevents data corruption from concurrent access and ensures predictable behavior in multi-user environments.

##### **Durability - "Permanent Changes"**
**Definition**: Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains committed even in the event of system failures, crashes, or power outages.

**Real-World Example**:
```
E-commerce Order Processing:
1. User places order for $100
2. Payment is processed and confirmed
3. Order is saved to database
4. Transaction is committed
5. System crashes due to power failure

After System Restart:
- Order is still in database ✓
- Payment confirmation is preserved ✓
- User can track their order ✓
- No data loss occurred ✓
```

**Implementation Details**:
- **Write-Ahead Logging**: Changes logged to disk before commit
- **Synchronous Writes**: Critical data written immediately (fsync)
- **Checkpointing**: Periodic flushing of dirty pages to disk
- **Recovery Procedures**: Automatic recovery after system restart

**Durability Levels**:
1. **Immediate Durability**: Data written to disk before commit acknowledgment
2. **Deferred Durability**: Data written to disk after commit acknowledgment (faster)
3. **Group Commit**: Multiple transactions written together for efficiency

**Why It Matters**: Ensures data persistence and prevents data loss. Critical for financial systems, legal records, and any application where data loss is unacceptable.

##### **Consistency**
```
Database Constraints:
- Account balance >= 0 (check constraint)
- Email addresses are unique (unique constraint)
- Foreign key relationships maintained (referential integrity)

Transaction ensures all constraints are satisfied before commit
Violation triggers rollback of entire transaction
```

##### **Isolation Levels**
```
Read Uncommitted: No isolation, dirty reads possible
Read Committed: Prevents dirty reads, allows non-repeatable reads
Repeatable Read: Prevents non-repeatable reads, allows phantom reads
Serializable: Highest isolation, prevents all anomalies

Implementation: Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)
- Each transaction sees snapshot of data at start
- Write operations create new versions
- Garbage collection removes old versions
```

##### **Durability**
```
Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Protocol:
1. Log transaction to disk (fsync)
2. Commit transaction
3. Data survives system crashes

Implementation Details:
- Log records: [LSN, Transaction ID, Operation, Before Image, After Image]
- Checkpointing: Periodically flush dirty pages to disk
- Recovery: Redo committed transactions, undo uncommitted transactions
```

#### **Scaling Mechanisms**

##### **Read Replicas**
```
Primary → [WAL] → Replicas
  ↓         ↓        ↓
[Writes] [Stream] [Reads]
[Master] [Async]  [Slaves]

Consistency Model: Eventual consistency
Replication Lag: 10ms-1s depending on network latency
Failover: Automatic promotion of replica to primary
```

##### **Sharding Strategies**
```
Hash-Based Sharding:
- Shard = hash(key) % num_shards
- Even distribution, no range queries across shards
- Rebalancing requires full data redistribution

Range-Based Sharding:
- Shard = key range assignment
- Efficient range queries within shard
- Potential hotspots, manual rebalancing

Directory-Based Sharding:
- Centralized mapping table
- Flexible assignment, single point of failure
- Consistent hashing for dynamic rebalancing
```

### 2. **Key-Value Stores**

#### **Historical Context & Design Philosophy**
Key-Value stores emerged in the 2000s to solve the **performance bottleneck** of traditional RDBMS systems. The primary goal was to achieve **sub-millisecond latency** for simple data access patterns while enabling **massive horizontal scaling**.

**Why Key-Value Stores Were Established:**
- **Performance Crisis**: RDBMS systems couldn't handle the scale of web applications (millions of users, billions of operations)
- **Simplicity Gap**: Most applications only needed simple get/put operations, not complex SQL queries
- **Scalability Limitations**: Vertical scaling (bigger machines) hit physical and cost limits
- **Memory Revolution**: Dramatic increase in RAM capacity made in-memory storage feasible

**Core Design Philosophy:**
Key-Value stores optimize for **write-heavy workloads with simple access patterns**. The design assumes that:
- Simple key-based lookups are the primary access pattern
- Data relationships are handled at the application level
- Performance is more important than complex querying
- Horizontal scaling is essential for growth

#### **Data Structure Optimization Strategy**
Key-Value stores employ **specialized data structures** optimized for specific access patterns:

**1. LSM Tree (Log-Structured Merge Tree) Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Random writes to B-trees cause poor performance due to disk seeks
- **LSM Solution**: Convert random writes to sequential writes using append-only logs
- **Performance Gain**: 10-100x write performance improvement over B-trees
- **Trade-off**: Slightly slower reads due to multiple SSTable lookups

**2. Bloom Filter Optimization:**
- **Problem**: LSM trees require checking multiple SSTables for key existence
- **Bloom Filter Solution**: Probabilistic data structure to quickly determine if key exists
- **Performance Gain**: 90% reduction in unnecessary disk I/O during lookups
- **Memory Cost**: 1-2 bits per key for 1% false positive rate

**3. Skiplist Optimization (Redis):**
- **Problem**: Traditional balanced trees have complex rebalancing during concurrent access
- **Skiplist Solution**: Probabilistic structure with O(log n) average performance
- **Concurrency Advantage**: Lock-free operations possible with careful implementation
- **Memory Efficiency**: O(n) space complexity with good cache locality

#### **Core Characteristics**

##### **Simple Data Model Explained**
**Key-Value pairs** represent the most fundamental data structure in computing. Each piece of data is identified by a unique key and associated with a value.

**Data Structure**:
```
Key-Value Pair: [Key] → [Value]
Examples:
- "user:123" → "{\"name\":\"John\",\"email\":\"john@example.com\"}"
- "session:abc123" → "{\"user_id\":123,\"login_time\":1640995200}"
- "counter:page_views" → "15000"
- "cache:product:456" → "{\"name\":\"iPhone\",\"price\":999}"
```

**Advantages**:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Flexibility**: Values can be any data type (strings, numbers, objects, binary)
- **Performance**: Direct key-based access without complex query processing
- **Scalability**: Easy to partition and distribute across nodes

**Limitations**:
- **No Relationships**: Cannot directly link related data
- **Limited Queries**: No complex filtering or aggregation
- **No Schema**: No enforced structure for data validation

##### **High Performance Fundamentals**
**Why Key-Value stores are fast**:

1. **Direct Access**: O(1) average case lookup using hash functions
2. **No Query Processing**: No SQL parsing, optimization, or execution plans
3. **Minimal Overhead**: Simple get/put/delete operations
4. **Memory-Optimized**: Often kept in memory for maximum speed

**Performance Characteristics**:
- **Latency**: 0.1-1ms for in-memory operations
- **Throughput**: 100K-1M operations per second per node
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling with additional nodes

##### **Horizontal Scaling Explained**
**Horizontal scaling** (scale-out) means adding more machines to handle increased load, rather than making existing machines more powerful.

**Scaling Strategies**:

**Consistent Hashing**:
```
Hash Ring: [0] → [Node A] → [256] → [Node B] → [512] → [Node C] → [1024]

Key Assignment:
- "user:123" → hash("user:123") = 456 → Node B
- "session:abc" → hash("session:abc") = 789 → Node C
- "counter:views" → hash("counter:views") = 123 → Node A

Benefits:
- Even distribution of keys across nodes
- Minimal rebalancing when adding/removing nodes
- Predictable key placement
```

**Partitioning Strategies**:
1. **Hash-Based**: Even distribution, no range queries
2. **Range-Based**: Efficient range queries, potential hotspots
3. **Directory-Based**: Flexible assignment, centralized control

**Replication Patterns**:
1. **Master-Slave**: Single master for writes, multiple slaves for reads
2. **Multi-Master**: Multiple nodes can handle writes
3. **Chain Replication**: Sequential replication for strong consistency

##### **Eventual Consistency Explained**
**Eventual consistency** is a consistency model where data may be temporarily inconsistent across replicas, but will eventually become consistent.

**Consistency Models**:

**Strong Consistency (Linearizability)**:
- All replicas show the same data immediately
- Higher latency, lower availability
- Use case: Financial transactions, user accounts

**Eventual Consistency**:
- Replicas may show different data temporarily
- Lower latency, higher availability
- Use case: Social media feeds, content delivery

**Consistency Patterns**:

**Read-Your-Writes**:
```
User writes data to Node A
User immediately reads from Node A
Result: Sees their own write immediately ✓
```

**Monotonic Reads**:
```
User reads data from Node A (version 1)
User reads data from Node B (version 2)
User reads data from Node A again
Result: Never sees older version than version 2 ✓
```

**Monotonic Writes**:
```
User writes update 1 to Node A
User writes update 2 to Node B
Result: Update 2 is applied after update 1 ✓
```

**Why Eventual Consistency Matters**:
- **Performance**: Faster writes and reads
- **Availability**: System remains available during network partitions
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale across multiple regions
- **Trade-offs**: Accepts temporary inconsistency for better performance

#### **Internal Mechanisms**

##### **Hash Tables**
```
Hash Function: h(key) = key % table_size

Table Size: 8
Keys: [15, 23, 45, 67, 89]

h(15) = 15 % 8 = 7 → Bucket 7
h(23) = 23 % 8 = 7 → Bucket 7 (Collision!)
h(45) = 45 % 8 = 5 → Bucket 5
h(67) = 67 % 8 = 3 → Bucket 3
h(89) = 89 % 8 = 1 → Bucket 1

Collision Resolution: Chaining
Bucket 7: [15] → [23]
```

**Hash Table Properties:**
- **O(1) Average Lookup**: Constant time complexity with good hash function
- **Collision Resolution**: Chaining, open addressing, cuckoo hashing
- **Memory Efficient**: Direct key mapping, minimal overhead
- **No Ordering**: Keys not sorted, no range query support

##### **LSM Trees (Log-Structured Merge Trees) Explained**

**What is an LSM Tree?**
An LSM Tree is a data structure designed for write-heavy workloads. It optimizes for write performance by batching writes and using sequential I/O operations, which are much faster than random I/O on modern storage systems.

**Core Principle**: "Write fast, read later" - prioritize write performance over read performance, then optimize reads through background processes.

**Why LSM Trees Were Invented:**
- **Disk I/O Bottleneck**: Random writes to B-trees cause poor performance (10-100x slower than sequential writes)
- **Write-Heavy Workloads**: Modern applications (logging, analytics, IoT) generate massive write volumes
- **SSD Characteristics**: SSDs have different performance characteristics than HDDs (no seek penalty, but wear leveling)
- **Memory Hierarchy**: Leverage fast memory for writes, slow disk for storage

**Deep Optimization Strategy:**
LSM trees solve the fundamental problem of **write amplification** in traditional B-trees by:

**1. Write Path Optimization:**
- **Problem**: B-trees require random disk seeks for each write operation
- **LSM Solution**: Buffer writes in memory, then flush sequentially to disk
- **Performance Gain**: 10-100x write performance improvement
- **Memory Trade-off**: Requires sufficient RAM for MemTable

**2. Read Path Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Multiple SSTables require checking multiple files for reads
- **LSM Solution**: Bloom filters + sorted SSTables + background compaction
- **Bloom Filter Impact**: 90% reduction in unnecessary disk I/O
- **Compaction Benefit**: Merges multiple SSTables into fewer, larger ones

**3. Compaction Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Without compaction, read performance degrades exponentially
- **LSM Solution**: Background merging of SSTables with size-tiered or leveled compaction
- **Size-Tiered**: Merge SSTables of similar sizes (RocksDB)
- **Leveled**: Maintain strict size ratios between levels (LevelDB)

**LSM Tree Architecture**:
```
Memory Level (MemTable):
[Key1:Value1] [Key2:Value2] [Key3:Value3] [Key4:Value4]

Disk Level (SSTables):
Level 0: [SSTable1] [SSTable2] [SSTable3] (small, overlapping)
Level 1: [Merged SSTable4] [Merged SSTable5] (larger, sorted)
Level 2: [Merged SSTable6] (even larger, sorted)
Level 3: [Merged SSTable7] (largest, sorted)

Compaction Process:
Level 0 → Level 1: Merge overlapping ranges, sort
Level 1 → Level 2: Merge and sort, remove duplicates
Level 2 → Level 3: Final merge, optimize for reads
```

**LSM Tree Operations Explained**:

**Write Operation (O(1) average case)**:
```
1. Write to MemTable (in-memory, sorted)
2. When MemTable is full (e.g., 64MB), flush to SSTable
3. SSTable written sequentially to disk
4. New MemTable created for incoming writes

Benefits:
- Sequential writes (fast)
- No random I/O during writes
- Immediate acknowledgment to client
```

**Read Operation (O(log n) with optimizations)**:
```
1. Check MemTable first (most recent data)
2. If not found, check Level 0 SSTables (may overlap)
3. If not found, check Level 1+ SSTables (sorted, no overlap)
4. Use Bloom filters to skip SSTables that don't contain the key

Optimizations:
- Bloom filters reduce unnecessary I/O
- SSTables are sorted for binary search
- Caching of frequently accessed data
```

**Compaction Process (Background)**:
```
Compaction Goals:
1. Merge multiple SSTables into fewer, larger ones
2. Remove duplicate keys (keep most recent)
3. Sort data for efficient reads
4. Reduce read amplification

Compaction Types:
- Minor Compaction: Level 0 → Level 1
- Major Compaction: Level 1+ → Level N
- Full Compaction: All levels → Single SSTable
```

**Bloom Filters Explained**:
A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that tests whether an element is a member of a set. It may return false positives but never false negatives.

**Why Bloom Filters Are Critical for LSM Trees:**
- **I/O Reduction**: Without Bloom filters, LSM trees would require checking every SSTable for every read
- **Performance Impact**: 90% reduction in unnecessary disk I/O for non-existent keys
- **Memory Efficiency**: 1-2 bits per key provides 1% false positive rate
- **Scalability**: Enables LSM trees to handle large numbers of SSTables efficiently

**Deep Optimization Details:**
```
Bloom Filter Operation:
1. Hash the key multiple times
2. Set bits in a bit array
3. Check if all bits are set for key lookup

Example:
Key: "user:123"
Hash1("user:123") = 5 → Set bit 5
Hash2("user:123") = 12 → Set bit 12
Hash3("user:123") = 23 → Set bit 23

Lookup "user:123":
- Check bits 5, 12, 23
- If all set → Key might exist (check SSTable)
- If any not set → Key definitely doesn't exist (skip SSTable)
```

**Mathematical Optimization:**
- **Optimal Hash Functions**: k = (m/n) * ln(2) where k=hash functions, m=bits, n=keys
- **False Positive Rate**: (1 - e^(-kn/m))^k where k=hash functions, n=keys, m=bits
- **Memory Optimization**: 10 bits per key gives 1% false positive rate
- **Hash Function Selection**: MurmurHash, FNV, or cryptographic hashes for distribution

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) where n is number of keys
- **Time Complexity**: O(k) where k is number of hash functions
- **False Positive Rate**: Configurable (typically 1-5%)
- **False Negative Rate**: 0% (never misses existing keys)

**LSM Tree Trade-offs**:

**Advantages**:
- **Write Performance**: O(1) average case, sequential I/O
- **Space Efficiency**: Excellent compression ratios
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets efficiently
- **Durability**: Data persisted to disk quickly

**Disadvantages**:
- **Read Performance**: May require checking multiple SSTables
- **Write Amplification**: Same data written multiple times during compaction
- **Space Amplification**: Multiple versions of data exist during compaction
- **Complexity**: Compaction process adds operational complexity

**Real-World Examples**:
- **RocksDB**: Facebook's LSM-based storage engine
- **LevelDB**: Google's LSM-based key-value store
- **Cassandra**: Uses LSM trees for storage
- **HBase**: Uses LSM trees for data storage

**When to Use LSM Trees**:
- **Write-heavy workloads**: Logging, analytics, time-series data
- **Large datasets**: Terabytes of data
- **Sequential I/O**: Modern SSDs and HDDs
- **Compression needed**: High compression ratios achievable

**Implementation Details:**
- **MemTable Size**: 64MB-256MB, in-memory sorted structure
- **SSTable Format**: Sorted key-value pairs with index
- **Compaction Policy**: Size-tiered or level-based
- **Write Amplification**: 10-50x depending on compaction strategy

Key Assignment:
Key "user123" → Hash(123) = 456 → Node B
Key "user456" → Hash(456) = 789 → Node C
Key "user789" → Hash(789) = 123 → Node A

Virtual Nodes: Each physical node mapped to multiple virtual nodes
Rebalancing: Only 1/n keys moved when adding/removing node
```

##### **Partitioning Strategies**
```
Hash Partitioning:
- Partition = hash(key) % num_partitions
- Even distribution, no range queries
- Rebalancing complexity

Range Partitioning:
- Partition = key range assignment
- Efficient range queries, potential hotspots
- Manual rebalancing required

### 3. **Wide Column Stores**

#### **Historical Context & Design Philosophy**
Wide Column stores emerged in the 2000s to solve the **analytical query performance bottleneck** of traditional row-oriented databases. The primary goal was to optimize for **read-heavy analytical workloads** while enabling **massive data volumes** and **complex aggregations**.

**Why Wide Column Stores Were Established:**
- **Analytical Performance Crisis**: Row-oriented databases couldn't handle complex analytical queries on large datasets
- **Data Warehouse Limitations**: Traditional data warehouses were too expensive and complex for operational analytics
- **Big Data Revolution**: Need to analyze petabytes of data with sub-second response times
- **Compression Requirements**: Storage costs were becoming prohibitive for large datasets

**Core Design Philosophy:**
Wide Column stores optimize for **analytical workloads with complex aggregations**. The design assumes that:
- Queries access only a subset of columns
- Aggregations and filtering are the primary operations
- Storage efficiency is critical for large datasets
- Read performance is more important than write performance

#### **Data Structure Optimization Strategy**
Wide Column stores employ **columnar optimization techniques** that fundamentally change how data is stored and accessed:

**1. Column-Oriented Storage Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Row-oriented storage reads entire rows even when only few columns are needed
- **Column-Oriented Solution**: Store data by columns, enabling selective column access
- **Performance Gain**: 10-100x improvement for analytical queries
- **I/O Reduction**: Read only required columns, not entire rows

**2. Compression Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Traditional compression works poorly on mixed data types in rows
- **Column-Oriented Compression**: Same data types in columns enable specialized compression
- **Compression Ratios**: 5-20x compression vs 2-3x for row-oriented
- **Memory Efficiency**: More data fits in memory, improving cache hit rates

**3. Vectorized Processing Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Row-by-row processing is inefficient for analytical operations
- **Vectorized Solution**: Process entire columns in SIMD operations
- **Performance Gain**: 10-50x improvement for aggregations and filtering
- **CPU Efficiency**: Better utilization of modern CPU vector instructions

#### **Core Characteristics**

##### **Column-Oriented Storage Explained**
**Column-oriented storage** (also called columnar storage) stores data by columns rather than by rows. This is fundamentally different from traditional row-oriented storage and provides significant advantages for analytical workloads.

**Row-Oriented vs Column-Oriented Storage**:

**Row-Oriented Storage (Traditional)**:
```
Table: Users
Row 1: [UserID: 1, Name: "John", Age: 25, City: "NYC", Email: "john@example.com"]
Row 2: [UserID: 2, Name: "Jane", Age: 30, City: "LA", Email: "jane@example.com"]
Row 3: [UserID: 3, Name: "Bob", Age: 35, City: "NYC", Email: "bob@example.com"]

Storage Layout:
[1, "John", 25, "NYC", "john@example.com] [2, "Jane", 30, "LA", "jane@example.com] [3, "Bob", 35, "NYC", "bob@example.com]
```

**Column-Oriented Storage**:
```
Table: Users
Column UserID: [1, 2, 3]
Column Name: ["John", "Jane", "Bob"]
Column Age: [25, 30, 35]
Column City: ["NYC", "LA", "NYC"]
Column Email: ["john@example.com", "jane@example.com", "bob@example.com"]

Storage Layout:
[1, 2, 3] ["John", "Jane", "Bob"] [25, 30, 35] ["NYC", "LA", "NYC"] ["john@example.com", "jane@example.com", "bob@example.com"]
```

**Why Column-Oriented Storage Matters**:

**Analytical Query Performance**:
```
Query: SELECT AVG(age) FROM users WHERE city = 'NYC'

Row-Oriented:
- Read entire rows for users in NYC
- Extract age values
- Calculate average
- I/O: Read many columns, use few

Column-Oriented:
- Read only city column (filter)
- Read only age column (aggregate)
- Calculate average
- I/O: Read only needed columns
```

**Compression Benefits**:
```
Column: City
Values: ["NYC", "LA", "NYC", "NYC", "LA", "NYC", "NYC"]

Dictionary Encoding:
Dictionary: {0: "NYC", 1: "LA"}
Encoded: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Compression: 7 strings → 7 integers + 2 strings
```

##### **Sparse Data Handling Explained**
**Sparse data** refers to datasets where many values are missing or null. Traditional row-oriented databases waste space storing null values, but column-oriented storage handles this efficiently.

**Sparse Data Example**:
```
User Profiles (some users have optional fields):
User 1: [name, age, city, phone, twitter] → ["John", 25, "NYC", "555-1234", null]
User 2: [name, age, city, phone, twitter] → ["Jane", 30, "LA", null, "@jane"]
User 3: [name, age, city, phone, twitter] → ["Bob", 35, "NYC", null, null]

Row-Oriented Storage:
- Each row stores all columns (including nulls)
- Wastes space on missing data

Column-Oriented Storage:
- Store only non-null values
- Use bitmaps to track which values exist
- Significant space savings
```

**Sparse Data Storage Techniques**:
1. **Null Bitmaps**: Track which values are null
2. **Run-Length Encoding**: Compress repeated values
3. **Dictionary Encoding**: Map unique values to integers
4. **Delta Encoding**: Store differences between consecutive values

##### **High Compression Explained**
**Compression** reduces storage space and improves I/O performance. Column-oriented storage achieves much higher compression ratios than row-oriented storage.

**Compression Techniques**:

**Dictionary Encoding**:
```
Original: ["NYC", "LA", "NYC", "NYC", "LA", "NYC"]
Dictionary: {0: "NYC", 1: "LA"}
Encoded: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
Compression Ratio: 6 strings → 6 integers + 2 strings
```

**Run-Length Encoding**:
```
Original: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]
Encoded: [(1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4)]
Compression Ratio: 9 values → 3 pairs
```

**Delta Encoding**:
```
Original: [1000, 1001, 1003, 1006, 1010]
Deltas: [1000, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Compression Ratio: 5 large numbers → 1 large + 4 small numbers
```

**Bit-Packing**:
```
Original: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Binary: [001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000]
Packed: Store as 3-bit integers where possible
```

**Compression Benefits**:
- **Storage Savings**: 5-20x compression ratios
- **I/O Performance**: Less data to read/write
- **Cache Efficiency**: More data fits in memory
- **Network Transfer**: Faster data movement

**Deep Compression Optimization Details:**

**1. Dictionary Encoding Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Repeated string values waste storage space and I/O bandwidth
- **Solution**: Map unique values to integers, store dictionary separately
- **Compression Ratio**: 5-20x for low-cardinality columns (e.g., country codes, status values)
- **Memory Efficiency**: Dictionary fits in memory, enabling fast lookups
- **Trade-off**: Dictionary must be loaded before accessing data

**2. Run-Length Encoding Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Consecutive identical values waste space and processing time
- **Solution**: Store (value, count) pairs instead of repeated values
- **Compression Ratio**: 2-10x for sorted columns with repeated values
- **Performance Gain**: Faster processing due to fewer values to iterate
- **Best For**: Sorted columns with many repeated values (e.g., dates, categories)

**3. Delta Encoding Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Sequential numeric values have predictable patterns that waste space
- **Solution**: Store differences between consecutive values
- **Compression Ratio**: 2-5x for sorted numeric columns
- **CPU Efficiency**: Simple arithmetic operations for reconstruction
- **Best For**: Timestamps, auto-incrementing IDs, sorted numeric data

**4. Bit-Packing Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Small integers stored in 32/64 bits waste significant space
- **Solution**: Pack multiple small integers into single machine word
- **Compression Ratio**: 2-8x for small integer columns
- **Memory Access**: Better cache locality due to compact storage
- **Best For**: Boolean flags, small counters, enumerated values

##### **Analytical Queries Explained**
**Analytical queries** are complex queries that aggregate, analyze, and report on large datasets. They typically involve:
- Aggregation functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)
- Grouping and sorting
- Complex filtering conditions
- Joins across multiple tables

**Analytical Query Examples**:

**Aggregation Queries**:
```sql
-- Row-oriented: Read all rows, extract age, calculate average
SELECT AVG(age) FROM users WHERE city = 'NYC';

-- Column-oriented: Read only age and city columns
-- Much faster due to less I/O and better compression
```

**Grouping Queries**:
```sql
-- Row-oriented: Read all data, group in memory
SELECT city, COUNT(*), AVG(age) 
FROM users 
GROUP BY city;

-- Column-oriented: Read only needed columns
-- Better memory utilization and cache efficiency
```

**Time-Series Analysis**:
```sql
-- Row-oriented: Read all sensor data
SELECT sensor_id, AVG(value), MAX(value), MIN(value)
FROM sensor_readings
WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
GROUP BY sensor_id;

-- Column-oriented: Read only time range and values
-- Excellent for time-series data analysis
```

**Why Column-Oriented is Better for Analytics**:
1. **Selective Reading**: Read only needed columns
2. **Better Compression**: Similar values compress well
3. **Vectorized Processing**: Process multiple values simultaneously
4. **Cache Efficiency**: More data fits in CPU cache
5. **Parallel Processing**: Process columns independently

#### **Storage Structure**
```
Row-Oriented (Traditional):
Row 1: [UserID: 1, Name: "John", Age: 25, City: "NYC"]
Row 2: [UserID: 2, Name: "Jane", Age: 30, City: "LA"]
Row 3: [UserID: 3, Name: "Bob", Age: 35, City: "NYC"]

Column-Oriented:
UserID: [1, 2, 3]
Name: ["John", "Jane", "Bob"]
Age: [25, 30, 35]
City: ["NYC", "LA", "NYC"]
```

**Column Family Design:**
```
Users Column Family:
- Basic Info: {name, email, age}
- Address: {street, city, state, zip}
- Preferences: {theme, language, notifications}

Posts Column Family:
- Content: {title, body, tags}
- Metadata: {author, timestamp, likes}
- Analytics: {views, shares, comments}
```

#### **Compression Techniques**
- **Run-Length Encoding**: Repeated values stored once with count
- **Dictionary Encoding**: Unique values mapped to integers
- **Delta Encoding**: Store differences between consecutive values
- **Bit-Packing**: Efficient storage of small integers

**Compression Ratios:**
- **Dictionary Encoding**: 10-100x for low-cardinality columns
- **Run-Length Encoding**: 2-10x for sorted columns
- **Delta Encoding**: 2-5x for time-series data
- **Overall**: 5-20x compression vs row-oriented storage

#### **Scaling Mechanisms**

##### **Partitioning by Row Key**
```
Partition Strategy: Hash-based on row key
Partition Size: 100MB-1GB per partition
Replication: 3-5 copies per partition across nodes

Example: Cassandra
- Consistent hashing for partition distribution
- Virtual nodes for even distribution
- Token-aware routing for efficient queries
```

##### **Column Family Scaling**
```
Column Family = Table
Partition = Row key range
Column = Attribute within row
Super Column = Nested column structure

Scaling Dimensions:
- Horizontal: Add nodes, redistribute partitions
- Vertical: Add columns, compress data
- Temporal: Time-based partitioning for time-series data
```

#### **Consistency Models**

##### **Tunable Consistency**
```
Consistency Levels:
ONE: Single replica acknowledgment
QUORUM: Majority of replicas
ALL: All replicas must acknowledge

Example: Cassandra
- Write consistency: ONE, QUORUM, ALL
- Read consistency: ONE, QUORUM, ALL
- Eventual consistency when QUORUM not used
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Data Warehousing**: Business intelligence, reporting
- **Time-Series Analytics**: IoT data, financial metrics
- **Log Analysis**: Application logs, system metrics
- **Content Management**: User-generated content, metadata

### 4. **Document Stores**

#### **Historical Context & Design Philosophy**
Document stores emerged in the 2000s to solve the **schema rigidity problem** of traditional RDBMS systems. The primary goal was to enable **flexible data modeling** for web applications while maintaining **query performance** and **scalability**.

**Why Document Stores Were Established:**
- **Schema Evolution Crisis**: RDBMS schema changes required expensive migrations and downtime
- **Web Application Complexity**: Modern web apps have rapidly evolving data structures
- **JSON Revolution**: JavaScript Object Notation became the de facto data format for web APIs
- **Development Speed**: Need for rapid iteration without database schema changes

**Core Design Philosophy:**
Document stores optimize for **flexible data modeling with good query performance**. The design assumes that:
- Data structures evolve rapidly and unpredictably
- Complex nested data is common (user profiles, product catalogs)
- Query patterns are known but data structure is flexible
- Development speed is more important than storage efficiency

#### **Data Structure Optimization Strategy**
Document stores employ **hybrid optimization techniques** that balance flexibility with performance:

**1. B-tree Index Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Flexible schema makes traditional indexing strategies inefficient
- **Solution**: Dynamic index creation on document fields with B-tree structures
- **Performance Gain**: O(log n) access for indexed fields
- **Memory Efficiency**: Indexes only on frequently queried fields

**2. Document Structure Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Nested documents require complex traversal for queries
- **Solution**: Flattened indexing with dot notation (e.g., "profile.name")
- **Query Performance**: Direct access to nested fields without document parsing
- **Storage Trade-off**: Index storage overhead for complex nested structures

**3. Aggregation Pipeline Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Complex analytical queries on flexible schema
- **Solution**: Pipeline-based processing with in-memory aggregation
- **Performance Gain**: 10-100x faster than traditional SQL for complex aggregations
- **Memory Usage**: Aggregation results cached in memory for repeated queries

#### **Core Characteristics**
- **Schema Flexibility**: No predefined structure required
- **Rich Data Types**: Nested objects, arrays, mixed types
- **Query Capabilities**: Complex queries on document structure
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Distributed across multiple nodes

#### **Document Structure**

      },
      {
        "type": "work",
        "street": "456 Business Ave",
        "city": "New York",
        "zip": "10002"
      }
    ]
  },
  "preferences": {
    "theme": "dark",
    "notifications": {
      "email": true,
      "sms": false,
      "push": true
    }
  },
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "last_login": "2024-01-20T14:45:00Z"
}
```

#### **Indexing Strategies**
```
Single Field Index:
{ "email": 1 } → Fast email lookups

Compound Index:
{ "age": 1, "city": 1 } → Fast age + city queries

Array Index:
{ "addresses.city": 1 } → Index on array elements

Text Index:
{ "profile.name": "text" } → Full-text search

Geospatial Index:
{ "location": "2dsphere" } → Location-based queries
```

**Index Implementation:**
- **B-tree Indexes**: Primary and secondary indexes
- **Text Indexes**: Inverted indexes for full-text search
- **Geospatial Indexes**: R-tree or grid-based spatial indexing
- **Compound Indexes**: Multi-field indexes for complex queries

#### **Scaling Mechanisms**

##### **Sharding Strategies**
```
Range-Based Sharding:
- Shard by document key ranges
- Efficient range queries within shard
- Manual rebalancing required

Hash-Based Sharding:
- Shard = hash(document_id) % num_shards
- Even distribution, no range queries across shards
- Automatic rebalancing possible

Zoned Sharding:
- Shard by geographic or logical zones
- Data locality, reduced cross-shard queries
- Zone-aware routing
```

##### **Replication Patterns**
```
Primary-Shadow Replication:
- Primary for writes and reads
- Shadow replicas for read scaling
- Eventual consistency between replicas

Active-Active Replication:
- Multiple active replicas
- Conflict resolution for concurrent writes
- Higher complexity, better availability
```

#### **Consistency Models**

##### **Read Concerns**
```

Majority: Return data acknowledged by majority
Linearizable: Return data that reflects all acknowledged writes
Snapshot: Return data from consistent snapshot
```

##### **Write Concerns**
```
Unacknowledged: Fire-and-forget writes
Acknowledged: Wait for primary acknowledgment
Majority: Wait for majority acknowledgment
Journaled: Wait for journal flush
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Content Management**: Articles, blogs, media metadata
- **User Profiles**: Personal information, preferences
- **Product Catalogs**: E-commerce, inventory management
- **API Data**: Flexible data storage, rapid iteration

### 5. **Time Series Databases**

#### **Historical Context & Design Philosophy**
Time Series databases emerged in the 2010s to solve the **IoT and monitoring data explosion**. The primary goal was to handle **massive write volumes** of time-stamped data while enabling **efficient time-based queries** and **automatic data lifecycle management**.

**Why Time Series Databases Were Established:**
- **IoT Revolution**: Billions of sensors generating time-stamped data every second
- **Monitoring Complexity**: Modern applications require real-time monitoring of thousands of metrics
- **Storage Explosion**: Traditional databases couldn't handle the write volume and storage requirements
- **Query Patterns**: Time-based queries (ranges, aggregations) are fundamentally different from traditional queries

**Core Design Philosophy:**
Time Series databases optimize for **write-heavy workloads with time-based access patterns**. The design assumes that:
- Data is always written in time order (append-only)
- Queries are primarily time-range based
- Data has natural expiration (old data becomes less relevant)
- Aggregations are common (min, max, avg over time periods)

#### **Data Structure Optimization Strategy**
Time Series databases employ **time-centric optimization techniques**:

**1. Time-Based Partitioning Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Traditional databases can't handle massive write volumes efficiently
- **Solution**: Partition data by time ranges (hours, days, months)
- **Performance Gain**: 10-100x write performance improvement
- **Query Efficiency**: Time-range queries only access relevant partitions

**2. Columnar Storage Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Time-series data has predictable patterns that waste space in row storage
- **Solution**: Store timestamps and values in separate columns
- **Compression Gain**: 5-20x compression due to similar values in time proximity
- **Query Performance**: Efficient aggregation over time ranges

**3. Downsampling Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Raw high-frequency data becomes too large for long-term storage
- **Solution**: Automatically aggregate data into lower-resolution summaries
- **Storage Savings**: 10-100x reduction in storage for historical data
- **Query Speed**: Fast access to aggregated data for trend analysis

#### **Core Characteristics**
- **Time-Ordered Data**: Optimized for time-based queries
- **High Write Throughput**: Efficient ingestion of time-series data
- **Data Retention**: Automatic data lifecycle management
- **Aggregation Functions**: Built-in time-based aggregations

#### **Storage Architecture**
```
Time Buckets:
Hour 1: [Data Points 1-3600]
Hour 2: [Data Points 3601-7200]
Hour 3: [Data Points 7201-10800]

Compression:
Raw Data: 1-minute intervals
Hourly Aggregates: Min, Max, Avg, Count
Daily Aggregates: Statistical summaries
```

**Time-Series Patterns:**
- **Regular Intervals**: Fixed time intervals (every second, minute, hour)
- **Irregular Events**: Logs, alerts, user actions
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Daily, weekly, monthly cycles
- **Trends**: Long-term data patterns and changes

#### **Optimization Techniques**
```
Downsampling:
Raw: 1-second data for 1 day
Hourly: 1-hour aggregates for 1 month
Daily: 1-day aggregates for 1 year
Monthly: 1-month aggregates for 10 years

Compression:
- Delta encoding for time values
- Run-length encoding for repeated values
- Dictionary encoding for string values
```

#### **Scaling Mechanisms**

##### **Time-Based Partitioning**
```
Partition Strategy: Time-based sharding
Partition Size: 1 day to 1 month per partition
Retention: Automatic deletion of old partitions

Example: InfluxDB
- Shard by time ranges
- Automatic shard creation and deletion
- Parallel query execution across shards
```

##### **Tag-Based Indexing**
```
Tag Indexes: Index on metadata tags
Tag Cardinality: High cardinality tags require special handling
Tag Optimization: Tag-based partitioning for efficient queries

Example: Prometheus
- Labels as tags for efficient filtering
- Label cardinality limits to prevent explosion
- Efficient label matcher queries
```

#### **Consistency Models**

##### **Eventual Consistency**
```
Write Model: Asynchronous writes to multiple replicas
Read Model: Read from any replica, eventual consistency
Durability: Configurable durability levels

Example: InfluxDB
- Eventual consistency for high write throughput
- Configurable replication factor
- Automatic failover and recovery
```

**Use Cases:**

### 6. **Text Search Engines**

#### **Historical Context & Design Philosophy**
Text Search engines emerged in the 1990s to solve the **information retrieval problem** of finding relevant documents in large text collections. The primary goal was to enable **semantic search** beyond simple keyword matching while providing **relevance ranking** and **real-time search capabilities**.

**Why Text Search Engines Were Established:**
- **Information Overload**: Traditional databases couldn't handle semantic search across large text collections
- **Web Search Revolution**: Need to index and search billions of web pages efficiently
- **Natural Language Processing**: Users expect search to understand intent, not just match keywords
- **Real-Time Requirements**: Search results must be updated as content changes

**Core Design Philosophy:**
Text Search engines optimize for **read-heavy workloads with complex relevance calculations**. The design assumes that:
- Text content is the primary data type
- Relevance ranking is more important than exact matching
- Search queries are short but content is long
- Real-time indexing is required for fresh results

#### **Data Structure Optimization Strategy**
Text Search engines employ **inverted index optimization techniques**:

**1. Inverted Index Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Traditional databases can't efficiently find documents containing specific terms
- **Solution**: Build inverted index mapping terms to document lists
- **Performance Gain**: O(1) term lookup, O(log n) document intersection
- **Memory Efficiency**: Compressed posting lists for large document collections

**2. Tokenization Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Raw text contains noise that reduces search quality
- **Solution**: Intelligent text processing (stemming, stop words, synonyms)
- **Search Quality**: 20-50% improvement in relevance through better tokenization
- **Language Support**: Multi-language tokenization for global applications

**3. Relevance Scoring Optimization:**
- **Problem**: Simple keyword matching doesn't reflect document relevance
- **Solution**: Sophisticated scoring algorithms (TF-IDF, BM25, neural ranking)
- **User Experience**: Better search results lead to higher user satisfaction
- **Business Impact**: Improved search quality increases conversion rates

#### **Core Characteristics**

##### **Full-Text Search Explained**
**Full-text search** is a technique for searching text content within documents, web pages, or any text-based data. Unlike traditional database searches that match exact values, full-text search can find documents containing specific words or phrases, even if they don't match exactly.

**Traditional vs Full-Text Search**:

**Traditional Database Search**:
```sql
-- Exact match only
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title = 'Machine Learning Basics';
-- Returns only exact matches, no partial matches
```

**Full-Text Search**:
```sql
-- Search for documents containing "machine learning"
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH(content) AGAINST('machine learning');
-- Returns documents containing "machine", "learning", or both
-- Ranks results by relevance
-- Handles variations and synonyms
```

**Full-Text Search Capabilities**:
1. **Keyword Matching**: Find documents containing specific words
2. **Phrase Search**: Find exact phrases within documents
3. **Boolean Search**: Combine terms with AND, OR, NOT
4. **Wildcard Search**: Use * and ? for pattern matching
5. **Proximity Search**: Find words within a certain distance
6. **Fuzzy Search**: Handle typos and spelling variations

##### **Relevance Scoring Explained**
**Relevance scoring** determines how well a document matches a search query and ranks results accordingly. Multiple factors contribute to the final score.

**TF-IDF Scoring (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**:

**Term Frequency (TF)**:
```
TF = (Number of times term appears in document) / (Total terms in document)

Example:
Document: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
Term: "fox"
TF = 1 / 9 = 0.111
```

**Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**:
```
IDF = log(Total documents / Documents containing term)

Example:
Total documents: 1000
Documents with "fox": 50
IDF = log(1000/50) = log(20) = 3.0
```

**TF-IDF Score**:
```
TF-IDF = TF × IDF
Example: 0.111 × 3.0 = 0.333
```

**BM25 Scoring (Improved TF-IDF)**:
```
BM25 = IDF × (TF × (k1 + 1)) / (TF + k1 × (1 - b + b × (doc_length / avg_doc_length)))

Parameters:
- k1: Controls term frequency saturation (typically 1.2)
- b: Controls length normalization (typically 0.75)
```

**Additional Scoring Factors**:

**Field Boosting**:
```
Title match: 3x weight
Content match: 1x weight
Tags match: 2x weight
```

**Proximity Scoring**:
```
Terms close together: Higher score
Terms far apart: Lower score
```

**Freshness**:
```
Recent documents: Higher score
Older documents: Lower score
```

**User Behavior**:
```
Click-through rate: Higher score
Time spent on page: Higher score
```

##### **Faceted Search Explained**
**Faceted search** (also called faceted navigation) allows users to filter search results by multiple criteria simultaneously. It provides a way to drill down into search results using various attributes.

**Faceted Search Example**:
```
E-commerce Product Search:
Query: "laptop"

Facets:
Brand: Apple (150), Dell (120), HP (80), Lenovo (60)
Price: $0-500 (50), $501-1000 (200), $1001+ (160)
Screen Size: 13" (100), 14" (120), 15" (90), 17" (40)
RAM: 8GB (200), 16GB (150), 32GB (60)

User selects: Brand=Apple, Price=$501-1000
Results: 80 Apple laptops in $501-1000 range
```

**Faceted Search Implementation**:
1. **Facet Extraction**: Identify filterable attributes
2. **Facet Counting**: Count documents for each facet value
3. **Facet Filtering**: Apply selected facets to narrow results
4. **Dynamic Facets**: Update facet counts based on current filters

##### **Real-Time Indexing Explained**
**Real-time indexing** allows newly added or updated documents to become searchable almost immediately, typically within seconds.

**Indexing Process**:
```
1. Document Addition:
   - Parse document content
   - Extract text and metadata
   - Tokenize and normalize terms
   - Update inverted index

2. Index Refresh:
   - Commit changes to search index
   - Make documents searchable
   - Update relevance scores
   - Refresh facet counts
```

**Real-Time vs Batch Indexing**:

**Real-Time Indexing**:
- **Latency**: 1-10 seconds
- **Use Case**: User-generated content, e-commerce
- **Trade-off**: Higher resource usage, immediate availability

**Batch Indexing**:
- **Latency**: Minutes to hours
- **Use Case**: Large document collections, analytics
- **Trade-off**: Lower resource usage, delayed availability
```

#### **Inverted Index Structure**
```
Documents:
Doc1: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
Doc2: "A quick brown dog jumps over the lazy fox"
Doc3: "The lazy fox sleeps while the quick dog runs"

Inverted Index:
"the": [Doc1:1, Doc3:1] → Positions 1 in both docs
"quick": [Doc1:2, Doc2:2, Doc3:6] → Position 2 in Doc1&2, 6 in Doc3
"brown": [Doc1:3, Doc2:3]
"fox": [Doc1:4, Doc2:6, Doc3:3]
"jumps": [Doc1:5, Doc2:4]
"over": [Doc1:6, Doc2:5]
"lazy": [Doc1:7, Doc2:7, Doc3:2]
"dog": [Doc1:8, Doc2:8, Doc3:7]
```

#### **Search Algorithms**
```
Boolean Search:
"quick AND brown" → Documents containing both words
"fox OR dog" → Documents containing either word
"quick NOT lazy" → Documents with "quick" but not "lazy"

Fuzzy Search:
"quik" → Matches "quick" (edit distance 1)
"browne" → Matches "brown" (edit distance 1)

Phrase Search:
"quick brown fox" → Exact phrase matching
```

**Relevance Scoring:**
- **TF-IDF**: Term frequency × inverse document frequency
- **BM25**: Advanced ranking function with document length normalization
- **Vector Similarity**: Cosine similarity for semantic search
- **Learning to Rank**: Machine learning-based ranking

#### **Scaling Mechanisms**

##### **Sharding Strategies**
```
Document-Based Sharding:
- Shard by document ID or hash
- Each shard contains complete documents
- Cross-shard queries require coordination

Term-Based Sharding:
- Shard by search terms
- Each shard contains subset of inverted index
- Efficient for term-specific queries
```

##### **Replication Patterns**
```
Primary-Shadow Replication:
- Primary for writes and reads
- Shadow replicas for read scaling
- Eventual consistency between replicas

Active-Active Replication:
- Multiple active replicas
- Conflict resolution for concurrent writes
- Higher complexity, better availability
```

#### **Consistency Models**

##### **Near Real-Time Consistency**
```
Indexing Latency: 1-10 seconds for new documents
Search Consistency: Near real-time, eventual consistency
Update Model: Asynchronous index updates

Example: Elasticsearch
- Near real-time indexing (1 second refresh)
- Eventual consistency for search results
- Configurable refresh intervals
```

**Use Cases:**
- **E-commerce Search**: Product discovery, filtering
- **Content Discovery**: Article search, media search
- **Log Analysis**: Error search, pattern matching
- **Knowledge Bases**: Documentation search, FAQs

## ⚖️ **Consistency Models**

### **What is Consistency?**
**Consistency** in distributed systems refers to the guarantee that all nodes in the system see the same data at the same time, or within a bounded time period. Different consistency models provide different guarantees about when and how data becomes consistent across replicas.

### **CAP Theorem Explained**
The **CAP Theorem** states that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee two out of three properties:

**Consistency (C)**: All nodes see the same data at the same time
**Availability (A)**: Every request receives a response (no timeout)
**Partition Tolerance (P)**: System continues operating despite network partitions

**CAP Trade-offs**:
- **CP Systems**: Choose consistency and partition tolerance over availability
- **AP Systems**: Choose availability and partition tolerance over consistency
- **CA Systems**: Choose consistency and availability over partition tolerance (rare in distributed systems)

### **Strong Consistency**

#### **Linearizability Explained**
**Linearizability** is the strongest consistency model for distributed systems. It ensures that all operations appear to execute atomically at some point between their invocation and completion.

**Linearizability Properties**:
1. **Real-time Ordering**: If operation A completes before operation B starts, A must appear to execute before B
2. **Atomicity**: Each operation appears to execute instantaneously at some point
3. **Global Ordering**: All nodes see operations in the same order

**Linearizability Example**:
```
Timeline:
T1: Client A writes X=1
T2: Client B writes X=2
T3: Client C reads X

Linearizable Execution:
- All clients see: X=1, then X=2
- Client C must see X=2 (most recent value)
- No client can see X=1 after X=2 was written
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- **Synchronous Replication**: All replicas must acknowledge before response
- **Global Clock**: All nodes must agree on operation ordering
- **Atomic Broadcast**: Operations must be delivered to all nodes in same order

**Use Cases**:
- **Financial Transactions**: Bank transfers, stock trades
- **User Account Data**: Authentication, authorization
- **Configuration Management**: System settings, feature flags
- **Leader Election**: Distributed coordination

**Trade-offs**:
- **Latency**: Higher latency due to synchronous replication
- **Availability**: Lower availability during network partitions
- **Complexity**: More complex implementation and coordination

#### **Sequential Consistency Explained**
**Sequential consistency** is a weaker form of consistency that ensures all operations appear to execute in some sequential order that is consistent with the order seen by each individual client.

**Sequential Consistency Properties**:
1. **Local Ordering**: Operations from the same client appear in program order
2. **Global Ordering**: All clients see operations in the same global order
3. **No Real-time Constraints**: No requirement for real-time ordering

**Sequential Consistency Example**:
```
Client A: write(X=1), write(X=2)
Client B: read(X), read(X)

Valid Orderings:
- A1, A2, B1(X=2), B2(X=2) ✓
- A1, B1(X=1), A2, B2(X=2) ✓
- B1(X=1), A1, A2, B2(X=2) ✓

Invalid Ordering:
- A1, A2, B1(X=1), B2(X=1) ✗ (B should see X=2)
```

**Implementation**:
- **Total Order Broadcast**: All operations delivered in same order
- **Replica Coordination**: All replicas apply operations in same order
- **Client Ordering**: Maintain operation order per client

#### **Causal Consistency Explained**
**Causal consistency** ensures that causally related operations are seen in the correct order by all clients, while allowing causally unrelated operations to be seen in different orders.

**Causal Relationships**:
1. **Program Order**: Operations from same client are causally related
2. **Read Dependency**: If client A reads value written by client B, A's subsequent operations are causally related to B's write
3. **Transitivity**: If A is causally related to B, and B to C, then A is causally related to C

**Causal Consistency Example**:
```
Client A: write(X=1)
Client B: read(X=1), write(Y=2)  // B's write depends on A's write
Client C: read(Y=2), write(Z=3)  // C's write depends on B's write

Causal Order: A → B → C (must be preserved)
Non-causal: Client D's independent writes can be reordered
```

**Implementation**:
- **Vector Clocks**: Track causal dependencies between operations
- **Dependency Tracking**: Maintain causal history per client
- **Ordering Enforcement**: Ensure causally related operations are ordered correctly

### **Eventual Consistency Explained**
**Eventual consistency** guarantees that if no new updates are made to a data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value.

**Eventual Consistency Properties**:
1. **Convergence**: All replicas eventually converge to the same state
2. **No Guaranteed Order**: No guarantee about when convergence happens
3. **Temporary Inconsistency**: Replicas may show different values temporarily

**Eventual Consistency Example**:
```
Initial State: All replicas have X=1
Update: Client writes X=2 to replica A

Timeline:
T1: Replica A shows X=2, others show X=1
T2: Replication propagates to replica B
T3: Replica A and B show X=2, C shows X=1
T4: All replicas show X=2 (convergence)
```

**Consistency Patterns**:

#### **Read-Your-Writes**
```
Client writes data to replica A
Client immediately reads from replica A
Result: Client sees their own write immediately ✓
```

#### **Monotonic Reads**
```
Client reads from replica A (version 1)
Client reads from replica B (version 2)
Client reads from replica A again
Result: Never sees older version than version 2 ✓
```

#### **Monotonic Writes**
```
Client writes update 1 to replica A
Client writes update 2 to replica B
Result: Update 2 is applied after update 1 ✓
```

#### **Consistent Prefix Reads**
```
Client sees operations in the same order they were applied
No guarantee about real-time ordering
```

**Implementation Strategies**:
- **Asynchronous Replication**: Updates propagated in background
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent updates to same data
- **Version Vectors**: Track update history and dependencies
- **Anti-Entropy**: Periodic synchronization between replicas

**Use Cases**:
- **Social Media Feeds**: Posts, comments, likes
- **Content Delivery**: News articles, blog posts
- **Analytics Data**: Metrics, logs, events
- **Caching Layers**: Application caches, CDNs

**Trade-offs**:
- **Performance**: Lower latency, higher throughput
- **Availability**: Higher availability during partitions
- **Simplicity**: Simpler implementation and coordination
- **Consistency**: Temporary inconsistency acceptable

### **Consistency Levels**
```
Strong: Linearizable, sequential consistency
Bounded Staleness: Eventual with bounded delay
Session: Consistency within user session
Eventual: No consistency guarantees
```

## 🔀 **DATA PARTITIONING & SHARDING STRATEGIES**

### **RDBMS Partitioning & Sharding**

#### **Table Partitioning Strategies**

**Range Partitioning:**
```
Implementation: Partition by value ranges
Use Cases: Time-series data, ordered data, date-based data
Advantages: Efficient range queries, natural data organization
Disadvantages: Potential hotspots, uneven distribution

Example (PostgreSQL):
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL,
    order_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);

CREATE TABLE orders_2023 PARTITION OF orders
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-01-01') TO ('2024-01-01');
CREATE TABLE orders_2024 PARTITION OF orders
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');
```

**Hash Partitioning:**
```
Implementation: Partition by hash function
Use Cases: Even distribution, no natural ordering
Advantages: Balanced load, predictable distribution
Disadvantages: Range queries inefficient, no natural grouping

Example (MySQL):
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT,
    username VARCHAR(50)
) PARTITION BY HASH(user_id) PARTITIONS 4;
```

**List Partitioning:**
```
Implementation: Partition by specific values
Use Cases: Categorical data, discrete values
Advantages: Direct partition access, clear organization
Disadvantages: Limited flexibility, manual management

Example (PostgreSQL):
CREATE TABLE sales (
    region_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL
) PARTITION BY LIST (region_id);

CREATE TABLE sales_us PARTITION OF sales
    FOR VALUES IN (1, 2, 3);
CREATE TABLE sales_eu PARTITION OF sales
    FOR VALUES IN (4, 5, 6);
```

#### **RDBMS Sharding Strategies**

**Hash-based Sharding:**
```
Mechanism: Consistent hashing of shard key
Implementation: User ID, UUID, hash function
Use Case: Even distribution, simple key-based access
Complexity: Medium

Example Implementation:
Shard 0: user_id % 4 = 0
Shard 1: user_id % 4 = 1
Shard 2: user_id % 4 = 2
Shard 3: user_id % 4 = 3

Key Distribution:
user_id 100 → 100 % 4 = 0 → Shard 0
user_id 101 → 101 % 4 = 1 → Shard 1
user_id 102 → 102 % 4 = 2 → Shard 2
user_id 103 → 103 % 4 = 3 → Shard 3
```

**Range-based Sharding:**
```
Mechanism: Key ranges assigned to shards
Implementation: Time-series data, ordered data
Use Case: Efficient range queries, natural ordering
Complexity: High

Example Implementation:
Shard 0: user_id 1-1000000
Shard 1: user_id 1000001-2000000
Shard 2: user_id 2000001-3000000
Shard 3: user_id 3000001-4000000

Query Optimization:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id BETWEEN 500000 AND 1500000;
-- Efficient: Can target specific shards
```

**Directory-based Sharding:**
```
Mechanism: Lookup table for shard assignment
Implementation: Complex requirements, dynamic assignment
Use Case: Flexibility, complex distribution logic
Complexity: High

Example Implementation:
Shard Directory:
{
  "user_1": "shard_0",
  "user_2": "shard_1",
  "user_3": "shard_2",
  "user_4": "shard_0"
}

Lookup Process:
1. Query shard directory for user_id
2. Route request to assigned shard
3. Execute query on target shard
```

#### **RDBMS Sharding Challenges & Solutions**

**Cross-shard Queries:**
```
Problem: Joins across multiple shards
Solutions:
1. Denormalization: Duplicate data across shards
2. Application-level joins: Fetch data from multiple shards
3. Query routing: Route queries to appropriate shards
4. Data duplication: Maintain copies for complex queries

Implementation Example:
-- Denormalized approach
CREATE TABLE user_orders (
    user_id INT,
    order_id INT,
    user_name VARCHAR(100),  -- Denormalized
    order_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL
) PARTITION BY HASH(user_id);

-- Application-level join
SELECT u.name, o.order_date, o.amount
FROM users u JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
WHERE u.user_id = 123;
-- Application fetches from both shards and joins in memory
```

**Transaction Management:**
```
Problem: ACID transactions across shards
Solutions:
1. Distributed transactions: 2PC, 3PC protocols
2. Saga pattern: Compensating transactions
3. Eventual consistency: Accept temporary inconsistency
4. Single-shard transactions: Design for co-location

Implementation Example (Saga Pattern):
1. Begin transaction on Shard A
2. Update user balance
3. Begin transaction on Shard B
4. Update order status
5. If step 4 fails, compensate step 2
6. Commit both transactions
```

**Data Distribution:**
```
Problem: Uneven shard load
Solutions:
1. Rebalancing: Move data between shards
2. Dynamic sharding: Add/remove shards
3. Consistent hashing: Minimal data movement
4. Virtual nodes: Better distribution

Implementation Example (Consistent Hashing):
Hash Ring: 0-1000
Node A: 0-250
Node B: 251-500
Node C: 501-750
Node D: 751-1000

Adding Node E:
Node A: 0-200
Node B: 201-400
Node C: 401-600
Node D: 601-800
Node E: 801-1000
-- Only data in ranges 201-250, 401-450, 601-650, 801-850 moves
```

- Minimal disruption
- O(log n) lookup complexity maintained
```

#### **Redis Cluster Partitioning**

**Hash Slots Implementation:**
```
Redis Cluster uses 16384 hash slots:
Slot 0-5461: Node A
Slot 5462-10922: Node B
Slot 10923-16383: Node C

Key Distribution:
Key "user:123" → CRC16("user:123") % 16384 = 5000 → Node A
Key "user:456" → CRC16("user:456") % 16384 = 10000 → Node B
Key "user:789" → CRC16("user:789") % 16384 = 15000 → Node C

Automatic Rebalancing:
- Redis automatically redistributes slots when nodes are added/removed
- Minimal data movement
- No manual intervention required
```

**Key Tags for Co-location:**
```
Hash Tag Syntax: {tag}key
Example: {user:123}profile, {user:123}settings, {user:123}preferences

Distribution:
All keys with same tag hash to same slot
Ensures related data co-located on same node

Implementation:
Key "{user:123}profile" → Hash("user:123") → Slot 5000 → Node A
Key "{user:123}settings" → Hash("user:123") → Slot 5000 → Node A
Key "{user:123}preferences" → Hash("user:123") → Slot 5000 → Node A
```

#### **DynamoDB Partitioning**

**Hash Partition Key:**
```
Simple Partition Key:

- Efficient range queries per user

Example Queries:
-- Efficient: Single partition
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE user_id = "123"

-- Efficient: Range within partition
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE user_id = "123" AND order_date > "2023-01-01"

-- Inefficient: Cross-partition
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE order_date > "2023-01-01"
```

**Global Secondary Indexes (GSI):**
```
GSI Partitioning:
Table: Users
Partition Key: user_id

```

### **Document Store Partitioning & Sharding**

#### **MongoDB Sharding Strategies**

**Hash-based Sharding:**
```
Implementation:
Shard Key: {user_id: "hashed"}
Distribution: Even across shards

Example:
user_id "123" → Hash("123") → Shard 0
user_id "456" → Hash("456") → Shard 1
user_id "789" → Hash("789") → Shard 2

Characteristics:
- Balanced load
- Range queries inefficient
- Simple implementation
```

**Range-based Sharding:**
```
Implementation:
Shard Key: {user_id: 1}
Distribution: User ID ranges across shards

Example:
Shard 0: user_id 1-1000000
Shard 1: user_id 1000001-2000000
Shard 2: user_id 2000001-3000000

Characteristics:
- Efficient range queries
- Potential hotspots
- Natural ordering
```

**Zoned Sharding:**
```
Implementation:
Zone: "us-east" → Shards 0, 1
Zone: "us-west" → Shards 2, 3
Zone: "eu-west" → Shards 4, 5

Use Cases:
- Geographic distribution
- Compliance requirements
- Performance optimization

Example:
Users in US East → Zone "us-east" → Shards 0, 1
Users in US West → Zone "us-west" → Shards 2, 3
Users in Europe → Zone "eu-west" → Shards 4, 5
```

#### **MongoDB Shard Key Selection**

**Cardinality Considerations:**
```
High Cardinality (Good):
- user_id, order_id, UUID
- Even distribution
- No hotspots

Low Cardinality (Avoid):
- status, category, region
- Uneven distribution
- Potential hotspots

Example:
Good: {user_id: 1}
Bad: {status: 1}  // Only a few possible values
```

**Write Distribution:**
```
Even Write Distribution (Good):
- Hash-based keys
- Random distribution
- No write hotspots

Monotonically Increasing (Avoid):
- Timestamps, auto-increment IDs
- Write hotspots
- Uneven distribution

Example:
Good: {user_id: "hashed"}
Bad: {created_at: 1}  // All writes to latest shard
```

**Query Pattern Support:**
```
Query-Optimized Shard Keys:
- Include fields used in queries
- Support common access patterns
- Enable efficient routing

Example:
Common Query: Find orders by user and date
Shard Key: {user_id: 1, order_date: -1}
Benefits:
- Efficient user-based queries
- Efficient date range queries per user
- Natural ordering
```

#### **MongoDB Chunk Management**

**Chunk Distribution:**
```
Chunk Structure:
Chunk 1: user_id 1-1000000 → Shard A
Chunk 2: user_id 1000001-2000000 → Shard B
Chunk 3: user_id 2000001-3000000 → Shard C

Chunk Size:
- Default: 64MB
- Configurable: 1MB to 1024MB
- Optimal: 64MB-128MB

Chunk Splitting:
- Automatic when chunk exceeds size limit
- Creates two equal chunks
- No data movement required
```

**Chunk Migration:**
```
Automatic Rebalancing:
- Monitors chunk distribution
- Moves chunks to balance load
- Background process
- Minimal impact on operations

Manual Migration:
- Move specific chunks
- Control distribution
- Maintenance operations
- Performance optimization

Jumbo Chunks:
- Chunks that cannot be split
- Manual intervention required
- Usually due to large documents
- Consider shard key redesign
```

### **Wide Column Store Partitioning & Sharding**

#### **Cassandra Partitioning Strategies**

**Hash Partitioning:**
```
Implementation:
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id UUID,
    username text,
    email text,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id)
);

Distribution:
- Consistent hashing
- Even distribution
- No natural ordering
- Range queries difficult

Example:
user_id "123" → Hash("123") → Token 1500 → Node B
user_id "456" → Hash("456") → Token 2500 → Node C
```

**Composite Partition Key:**
```
Implementation:
CREATE TABLE user_posts (
    user_id UUID,
    post_id UUID,
    content text,
    created_at timestamp,
    PRIMARY KEY ((user_id, post_id), created_at)
);

Distribution:
- Partition by (user_id, post_id)
- Clustering by created_at
- Efficient user-based queries
- Time-based ordering within user

Example:
Partition Key: (user_123, post_456)
Clustering Key: created_at
Distribution: All posts by user_123 in same partition
```

**Time-based Partitioning:**
```
Implementation:
CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
    sensor_id UUID,
    bucket text,  -- Daily bucket: 2023-01-01
    timestamp timestamp,
    value double,
    PRIMARY KEY ((sensor_id, bucket), timestamp)
);

Distribution:
- Partition by (sensor_id, bucket)
- Time-based buckets
- Efficient time-range queries
- Automatic data lifecycle

Example:
Partition: (sensor_123, "2023-01-01")

Node B: Tokens [250, 1250, 2250, 3250]
Node C: Tokens [500, 1500, 2500, 3500]
Node D: Tokens [750, 1750, 2750, 3750]

Benefits:
- Better load distribution
- Easier rebalancing
- Reduced hotspots
- Improved fault tolerance

Partition Distribution:
Partition Key Hash → Token → Node
user:123 → Hash(123) = 1500 → Node B
user:456 → Hash(456) = 2500 → Node C
```

**Token Assignment:**
```
Token Calculation:
Token = Hash(partition_key) % 2^64

Example:
user_id "123" → Hash("123") = 0x1234567890ABCDEF
Token = 0x1234567890ABCDEF % 2^64 = 1500

Node Assignment:
Find node with token >= calculated_token
If no node found, assign to first node

Replication:
Replica placement based on replication strategy
SimpleStrategy: Next N nodes in ring
NetworkTopologyStrategy: Per datacenter
```

#### **Cassandra Partitioning Best Practices**

**High Cardinality:**
```
Good Practice:
- Use unique partition keys
- Avoid low-cardinality keys
- Consider hash-based keys

Example:
Good: user_id (UUID), order_id (UUID)
Bad: status (enum), region (limited values)

Implementation:
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    user_id UUID,  -- High cardinality
    profile_data text,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id)
);
```

**Avoid Hotspots:**
```
Hotspot Prevention:
- Use composite partition keys

CREATE TABLE events (
    event_type text,
    bucket text,  -- Daily bucket
    timestamp timestamp,
    event_data text,
    PRIMARY KEY ((event_type, bucket), timestamp)
);

Benefits:
- Prevents time-based hotspots
- Enables efficient time queries
- Supports TTL-based cleanup
```

**Query Optimization:**
```
Design for Query Patterns:
- Denormalize for query efficiency
- Use materialized views
- Consider secondary indexes

Example:
Denormalized Design:
CREATE TABLE user_orders (
    user_id UUID,
    order_id UUID,
    user_name text,  -- Denormalized
    order_date timestamp,
    amount decimal,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, order_id)
);

Benefits:
- Single partition queries
