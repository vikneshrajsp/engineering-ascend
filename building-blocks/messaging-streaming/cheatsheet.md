## üìà **DELIVERY PATTERNS**

### **At-Most-Once Delivery**
- Messages may be lost, no duplicates
- Highest throughput, lowest latency
- Fire-and-forget, no acknowledgments
- Use cases: Non-critical notifications, metrics

### **At-Least-Once Delivery**
- Messages guaranteed delivery, may have duplicates
- Medium throughput, reliable delivery
- Acknowledgments, retry mechanisms
- Use cases: Most business applications, data processing

### **Exactly-Once Delivery**
- Messages delivered exactly once
- Lower throughput, highest reliability
- Idempotency, deduplication
- Use cases: Financial transactions, critical operations

---

## üîÑ **MESSAGE ORDERING**

### **Global Ordering**
- All messages in strict order
- Lower throughput, higher latency
- Single partition, sequential processing
- Use cases: Financial transactions, audit trails

### **Partition Ordering**
- Messages ordered within partitions
- Higher throughput, parallel processing
- Partitioned streams, key-based routing
- Use cases: Most streaming applications

### **No Ordering**
- No guarantee on message order
- Highest throughput, lowest latency
- Parallel processing, no ordering constraints
- Use cases: Independent events, notifications

---

## üöÄ **BACKPRESSURE HANDLING**

### **Reactive Backpressure**
- Consumer controls flow rate
- Adaptive throughput, resource efficient
- Pull-based consumption, flow control
- Use cases: Variable load scenarios

### **Buffering Backpressure**
- Buffer messages during high load
- Smooth throughput, memory usage
- In-memory buffers, disk spilling
- Use cases: Burst traffic handling

### **Drop Backpressure**
- Drop messages during overload
- Consistent latency, data loss
- Circuit breakers, load shedding
- Use cases: Real-time systems, non-critical data

## üìö **QUICK REFERENCE**

### **Performance Formulas**
```
Throughput = Messages per second
Latency = End-to-end processing time
Reliability = (Successful deliveries / Total messages) √ó 100
Scalability = Linear scaling with partitions
```

### **Scaling Patterns**
```
Horizontal Scaling: Add more partitions/consumers
Vertical Scaling: Increase resources per node
Geographic Scaling: Multi-region deployment
Auto-scaling: Dynamic resource allocation
```

### **Common Patterns**
```
Producer-Consumer: Asynchronous processing
Fan-Out: One-to-many message distribution
Event Sourcing: State reconstruction from events
CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation
```
