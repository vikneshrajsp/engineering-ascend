## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Choose a Building Block** - Start with the one most relevant to your current project
2. **Read the Handbook** - Get comprehensive understanding
3. **Review the Summary** - Reinforce key concepts
4. **Use the Cheatsheet** - Quick reference during implementation
5. **Practice with Challenges** - Apply concepts to real problems

## üìä Decision Framework

When choosing building blocks for your system:

### **Scale Considerations**
- **Small Scale** (< 1M users): Start simple, add complexity as needed
- **Medium Scale** (1M-10M users): Focus on caching and basic distribution
- **Large Scale** (> 10M users): Full distributed architecture required

### **Performance Requirements**
- **Low Latency** (< 100ms): Prioritize caching and CDN
- **High Throughput** (> 10K req/s): Focus on message queuing and horizontal scaling
- **High Availability** (99.9%+): Implement redundancy and monitoring

### **Data Requirements**
- **Structured Data**: Relational databases with caching
- **Unstructured Data**: NoSQL with search capabilities
- **Real-time Analytics**: Stream processing with time-series databases
