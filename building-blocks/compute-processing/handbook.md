## üèóÔ∏è **Compute System Design Principles**

### **Core Design Philosophy**
Compute systems are **execution engine building blocks** that transform input data into output results. Every compute decision affects:
- **System performance** and user experience
- **Resource utilization** and cost structure
- **Scalability** and growth potential
- **Operational complexity** and reliability

### **Fundamental Principles**

#### **1. Amdahl's Law vs Gustafson's Law**
```
Amdahl's Law: Speedup = 1 / ((1 - p) + p/s)
- p = parallelizable fraction
- s = speedup factor for parallel portion
- Limits: Diminishing returns with more processors

Gustafson's Law: Speedup = s + p(1 - s)
- s = serial fraction
- p = number of processors
- Reality: Larger problems scale efficiently
```

**Key Insights:**
- **Amdahl's Law**: Applies to fixed problem sizes
- **Gustafson's Law**: Applies to scalable problem sizes
- **Practical Reality**: Most real-world problems scale with data size

#### **2. Compute Performance Trade-offs**
- **Latency vs Throughput**: Optimize for primary requirement
- **Serial vs Parallel**: Sequential efficiency vs parallel scalability
- **General vs Specialized**: Flexibility vs performance
- **Cost vs Performance**: Resource cost vs computational capability

#### **3. Workload Characteristics**
Compute systems should be optimized for your **primary workload patterns**:
- **CPU-bound vs I/O-bound workloads**
- **Sequential vs Parallel processing**
- **Batch vs Real-time processing**
- **General-purpose vs Specialized workloads**

| **Flexibility** | 10% | How adaptable is it to changes? | General-purpose vs specialized |
| **Team Expertise** | 10% | Does the team have the skills? | Learning curve, existing knowledge |

### **Decision Process**
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand computational and performance requirements
2. **Candidate Selection**: Identify 2-3 viable compute approaches
3. **Trade-off Analysis**: Evaluate each option against decision criteria
4. **Risk Assessment**: Consider failure modes and mitigation strategies
