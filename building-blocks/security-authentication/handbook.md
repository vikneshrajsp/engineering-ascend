## üìã **Overview**

### **What is Security & Authentication?**
Security & Authentication systems provide mechanisms to verify user identity, control access to resources, and protect data from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure.

### **Security Impact**
- **Attack Prevention**: 90%+ reduction in common attacks
- **Compliance**: 100% regulatory compliance achievement
- **User Trust**: Significant improvement in user confidence
- **Data Protection**: Comprehensive data security and privacy

## üîë **Authentication Fundamentals**

### **Authentication vs Authorization**
```
Authentication: "Who are you?" (Identity verification)
Authorization: "What can you do?" (Access control)

Example:
- Authentication: User provides username/password
- Authorization: System checks if user can access specific resource
```

### **Security Principles**
- **Confidentiality**: Data is protected from unauthorized access
- **Integrity**: Data cannot be modified without detection
- **Availability**: Systems remain accessible to authorized users
- **Non-repudiation**: Actions cannot be denied by the user
