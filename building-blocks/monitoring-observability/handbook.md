- Storage: Minimal storage with delta compression

Example:
http_requests_total{method="GET", status="200"} 1234
http_requests_total{method="POST", status="500"} 56

Rate Calculation:
rate(http_requests_total[5m]) = requests per second
```

#### **Gauge Metrics**
```
Gauge Optimization Strategy:
- Problem: Current values need historical context
- Solution: Time-series storage with interpolation
- Performance: O(1) update operations
- Storage: Efficient compression for smooth values

Example:
cpu_usage_percent{instance="web-01"} 75.2
memory_usage_bytes{instance="web-01"} 8589934592

Analysis:
- Current value: 75.2%
- Trend: Increasing over last hour
- Threshold: Alert if > 90%
```

#### **Histogram Metrics**
```
Histogram Optimization Strategy:
- Problem: Distribution analysis requires detailed data

```

#### **Summary Metrics**
```
Summary Optimization Strategy:
- Problem: Statistical summaries need efficient calculation

http_request_duration_seconds_count 2000

Average Calculation:
http_request_duration_seconds_sum / http_request_duration_seconds_count = 0.617s
```

### **Metrics Collection Architecture**
