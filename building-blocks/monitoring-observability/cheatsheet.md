#### **Q1: "Monitoring is too expensive"**
**A: FALSE** - Monitoring is an investment that prevents costly outages:
- **Cost of Outage**: $300K+ average cost per hour of downtime
- **Monitoring Investment**: 1-3% of infrastructure cost typically sufficient
- **ROI**: Monitoring investments typically pay for themselves

#### **Q2: "Logs are enough for monitoring"**
**A: FALSE** - Logs alone are insufficient for comprehensive monitoring:

- **Observability Need**: Need metrics and traces for full observability
- **Best Practice**: Implement all three pillars (logs, metrics, traces)

#### **Q3: "Alert on everything"**
**A: FALSE** - Too many alerts cause alert fatigue:
- **Alert Fatigue**: 90%+ of alerts are ignored when there are too many
- **Best Practice**: Alert only on actionable issues

#### **Q4: "Monitoring has no performance impact"**
**A: FALSE** - Monitoring has overhead that must be considered:
- **Performance Impact**: 1-15% overhead depending on implementation
- **Optimization**: Use sampling and efficient collection
- **Trade-off**: Balance visibility with performance

#### **Q5: "Set up monitoring once and forget it"**
**A: FALSE** - Monitoring requires ongoing maintenance:
- **Evolving Systems**: Systems change, monitoring must adapt
