# System Design Building Blocks

> The 8 core components that form the foundation of every scalable system design.

## üèóÔ∏è Overview

System design building blocks are the fundamental components that architects use to build scalable, reliable, and efficient systems. Each building block serves a specific purpose and can be combined in various ways to create complex distributed systems.

## üìö Building Blocks

- Data encryption at rest and in transit

**Technologies**: OAuth 2.0, JWT, SSL/TLS, API Gateway, WAF

### 7. [Monitoring & Observability](./monitoring-observability/README/)
**Purpose**: Monitor system health and debug issues

**Key Concepts**:
- Metrics, logging, and tracing
- Alerting and incident response
- Distributed tracing
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and debugging

## üìñ Documentation Levels

Each building block includes three levels of documentation:

### üìò **Handbook** (Complete Guide)
- Comprehensive technical deep-dive
- Real-world examples and case studies
- Implementation details and trade-offs
- Best practices and anti-patterns
- Performance characteristics and benchmarks

### üìã **Summary** (Quick Reference)
- Key concepts and principles
- Technology comparisons
- Decision frameworks
- Common patterns and solutions
- Quick reference tables

### üìù **Cheatsheet** (Key Points)
- Essential formulas and metrics
- Quick decision trees
- Common configurations
- Troubleshooting guides
- Interview tips and tricks

## üéØ Learning Path

### Beginner Level
1. Start with **Data Storage** and **Caching** - fundamental concepts
2. Learn **Networking** basics - how systems communicate
3. Understand **Security** fundamentals - protecting your systems

### Intermediate Level
4. Master **Message Queuing** - asynchronous processing
5. Explore **Compute & Processing** - scaling application logic
6. Implement **Monitoring** - observability and debugging

### Advanced Level
7. Deep dive into **Scalability & Distribution** - distributed systems
8. Combine all blocks - design complex systems

## üîß Framework Integration

These building blocks integrate with the structured approach:

- **Requirements & Constraints** - Use building blocks to understand system requirements
- **Estimation & Scale** - Apply quantitative metrics for capacity planning
- **System Interface Design** - Design APIs using networking and communication patterns
- **High-Level Architecture** - Combine building blocks for overall system design
- **Application Layer Design** - Implement business logic using compute and processing
- **Data Layer Design** - Choose appropriate data storage and caching strategies
- **Error Handling & Edge Cases** - Implement monitoring and security measures
- **Deployment & Monitoring** - Use scalability patterns for deployment

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Choose a Building Block** - Start with the one most relevant to your current project
2. **Read the Handbook** - Get comprehensive understanding
3. **Review the Summary** - Reinforce key concepts
4. **Use the Cheatsheet** - Quick reference during implementation
5. **Practice with Challenges** - Apply concepts to real problems

## üìä Decision Framework

When choosing building blocks for your system:

### **Scale Considerations**
- **Small Scale** (< 1M users): Start simple, add complexity as needed
- **Medium Scale** (1M-10M users): Focus on caching and basic distribution
- **Large Scale** (> 10M users): Full distributed architecture required

### **Performance Requirements**
- **Low Latency** (< 100ms): Prioritize caching and CDN
- **High Throughput** (> 10K req/s): Focus on message queuing and horizontal scaling
- **High Availability** (99.9%+): Implement redundancy and monitoring

### **Data Requirements**
- **Structured Data**: Relational databases with caching
- **Unstructured Data**: NoSQL with search capabilities
- **Real-time Analytics**: Stream processing with time-series databases
