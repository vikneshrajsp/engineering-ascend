## üìä **Quantitative Analysis**

Master the art of back-of-envelope calculations:

- **[Quantitative Metrics](./quantitative-metrics.md)** - Essential metrics for system design
- **[Back-of-Envelope Estimation](./back-of-envelope-estimation.md)** - Framework for quick calculations

## üõ†Ô∏è **Learning Framework**

Each system design challenge follows a structured approach:

1. **Requirements & Constraints** - Clarify functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Estimation & Scale** - Back-of-envelope calculations and capacity planning
3. **System Interface Design** - Define APIs and data contracts
4. **High-Level Architecture** - Overall system design and component interaction
5. **Application Layer Design** - Business logic and service architecture
6. **Data Layer Design** - Database design and data access patterns
7. **Error Handling & Edge Cases** - Failure scenarios and recovery mechanisms
8. **Deployment & Monitoring** - Infrastructure and observability

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

1. **Begin with [Building Blocks](./building-blocks/)** - Understand fundamentals
2. **Practice with [Challenges](./system-design-challenges/)** - Apply knowledge to real scenarios
3. **Master [Estimation](./quantitative-metrics.md)** - Develop quick calculation skills
4. **Review [Trade-offs](./trade-off-analysis.md)** - Understand design decisions

## üìö **Additional Resources**

- **[System Design Cheatsheet](./cheatsheet.md)** - Essential concepts and patterns
- **[Context & Background](./context.md)** - Understanding the bigger picture
- **[Decision Framework](./decision-framework.md)** - Making architectural decisions
