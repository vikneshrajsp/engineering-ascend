# Design Payment System - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design a payment system for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about PayPal scale (400M+ users) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Payment processing, fraud detection, compliance, or all of them?
3. **Payment Methods**: Credit cards, bank transfers, digital wallets, or all payment types?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific compliance, security, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with PayPal scale and focus on the core features: payment processing, fraud detection, compliance, and global payments."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing a payment system at scale with:
- 400M+ monthly active users
- Core features: payment processing, fraud detection, compliance, global payments
- Multiple payment methods and currencies
- PCI DSS compliance and global regulations

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Payment Processing**: How do we process millions of transactions securely and reliably?
2. **Fraud Detection**: How do we detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time?
3. **Compliance Management**: How do we ensure PCI DSS, GDPR, and regional compliance?
4. **Global Payments**: How do we handle multiple currencies and regional regulations?
5. **Transaction Consistency**: How do we ensure ACID properties across distributed systems?
6. **Risk Management**: How do we manage financial risk and chargeback handling?

The crux is balancing security and compliance with performance and scalability while handling global financial regulations."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**User Scale:**
- 400M monthly active users
- Assuming 25% daily active users = 100M DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 100M × 0.1 = 10M concurrent
- Peak factor: 5x for peak hours (shopping seasons)

**Transaction Scale:**
- Average user makes 2 transactions/day = 200M transactions/day
- Peak transactions per second: 200M ÷ 86400 × 5 = 11.6K transactions/second
- Transaction value: $50 average = $10B daily volume
- Peak value per second: 11.6K × $50 = $580K/second

**Storage Scale:**
- Transaction size: 2KB metadata + 1KB logs = 3KB
- Daily storage: 200M × 3KB = 600GB/day
- Audit logs: 200M × 2KB = 400GB/day
- Total daily storage: 1TB/day

**Financial Scale:**
- Daily volume: $10B
- Annual volume: $10B × 400 = $4T
- Processing fees: 2.9% average = $116M daily revenue
- Fraud losses: 0.1% = $10M daily risk

These numbers tell me we need a highly secure, compliant system that can handle billions of dollars while maintaining real-time fraud detection."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Event-driven microservices with strong consistency
**Security Strategy**: Multi-layer security with real-time fraud detection
**Compliance Strategy**: Built-in compliance with audit trails and reporting
**Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling with intelligent partitioning

**Key Design Principles:**
1. **Security First**: Prioritize security and fraud prevention
2. **Compliance Built-in**: Ensure regulatory compliance from the ground up
3. **Real-time Processing**: Process transactions with minimal latency
4. **Global Scale**: Handle multiple currencies and regional requirements
