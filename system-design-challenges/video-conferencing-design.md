# Design Video Conferencing - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design a video conferencing system for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Zoom scale (300M+ users) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Video/audio streaming, screen sharing, recording, or all of them?
3. **Platforms**: Web, mobile apps, desktop apps, or all platforms?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Zoom scale and focus on the core features: video/audio streaming, screen sharing, recording, and real-time communication."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing a video conferencing system at scale with:
- 300M+ monthly active users
- Core features: video/audio streaming, screen sharing, recording, real-time communication
- Multiple platforms (web, mobile, desktop)
- Global scale with sub-second latency

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Real-time Video Streaming**: How do we stream video/audio to millions of users with minimal latency?
2. **Screen Sharing**: How do we handle screen sharing with high quality and low latency?
3. **Recording**: How do we record and store massive amounts of video content?
4. **Scalability**: How do we scale to handle thousands of concurrent meetings?
5. **Network Optimization**: How do we handle different network conditions and bandwidth?
6. **Cross-platform Support**: How do we ensure consistent experience across all platforms?

The crux is balancing real-time performance with video quality while handling massive scale and diverse network conditions."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**User Scale:**
- 300M monthly active users
- Assuming 20% daily active users = 60M DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 60M × 0.1 = 6M concurrent
- Peak factor: 5x for peak hours (work hours)

**Meeting Scale:**
- Average user joins 2 meetings/day = 120M meetings/day
- Average meeting duration: 30 minutes
- Peak meetings per second: 120M ÷ 86400 × 5 = 6.9K meetings/second
- Concurrent meetings: 6.9K × 30 × 60 = 12.4M concurrent meetings

**Video Scale:**
- Average video quality: 720p (1.5Mbps)
- Audio quality: 64kbps
- Total bandwidth per user: 1.5Mbps + 64kbps = 1.56Mbps
- Peak bandwidth: 6M × 1.56Mbps = 9.36Tbps

**Storage Scale:**
- Recording rate: 10% of meetings recorded
- Average recording size: 30 minutes × 1.5Mbps = 337.5MB
- Daily storage: 12M × 337.5MB = 4.05PB/day
- Annual storage: 4.05PB × 400 = 1.62EB/year

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed real-time system with intelligent video processing and network optimization."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Real-time video streaming with distributed processing
**Video Strategy**: Adaptive bitrate streaming with intelligent quality adjustment
**Network Strategy**: Global distribution with intelligent routing and optimization
**Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling with intelligent meeting distribution
