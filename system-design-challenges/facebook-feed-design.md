# Design Facebook Feed - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design Facebook Feed for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Facebook scale (2B+ users) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? News feed, content ranking, real-time updates, or all of them?
3. **Content Types**: What types of content? Posts, photos, videos, stories, or mixed content types?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Facebook scale and focus on news feed, content ranking, real-time updates, and content moderation."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing Facebook Feed at scale with:
- 2B+ monthly active users
- Core features: news feed, content ranking, real-time updates, content moderation
- Multiple content types and real-time processing
- Global scale with intelligent content curation

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Content Generation**: How do we handle billions of content pieces being created daily?
2. **Feed Ranking**: How do we rank and personalize content for billions of users in real-time?
3. **Real-time Updates**: How do we provide real-time feed updates to millions of users simultaneously?
4. **Content Moderation**: How do we moderate and filter inappropriate content at scale?
5. **Personalization**: How do we provide personalized content for each user?
6. **Performance**: How do we maintain sub-second response times for feed generation?

The crux is balancing real-time content processing with intelligent ranking while maintaining performance and content quality for billions of users worldwide."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**User Scale:**
- Total users: 2 billion monthly active users
- Daily active users: 2B × 0.6 = 1.2B DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 1.2B × 0.1 = 120M concurrent
- Peak factor: 3x for peak hours (evening social media)

**Content Scale:**
- Posts per user per day: 2 posts average
- Total daily posts: 1.2B × 2 = 2.4B posts/day
- Peak posts per second: 2.4B ÷ 86400 × 3 = 83K posts/second
- Content types: Text (40%), Photos (35%), Videos (20%), Stories (5%)

**Feed Scale:**
- Feed requests per user per day: 20 requests average
- Total daily feed requests: 1.2B × 20 = 24B requests/day
- Peak feed requests per second: 24B ÷ 86400 × 3 = 833K requests/second
- Feed generation time: <1 second target

**Performance Scale:**
- Feed generation: <1 second for 99.9% of requests
- Content ranking: <500ms for 99.9% of rankings
- Real-time updates: <2 seconds for 99.9% of updates
- Content moderation: <5 seconds for 99.9% of content

**Storage Scale:**
- Post size: 1KB average for text, 100KB for photos, 10MB for videos
- Daily content storage: 2.4B × 10KB = 24TB/day
- User data: 2B users × 5KB = 10TB
- Total storage: 100PB+ content and metadata

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed social media system with intelligent content ranking and real-time processing."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Distributed social media with intelligent content ranking
