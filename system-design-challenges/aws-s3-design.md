# Design AWS S3 - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design AWS S3 for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about S3's current scale (100+ trillion objects) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Object storage, versioning, lifecycle management, or all of them?
3. **Storage Classes**: Should I include different storage tiers (Standard, IA, Glacier)?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with S3's current scale and focus on the core features: object storage, versioning, lifecycle management, and global distribution."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing AWS S3 at scale with:
- 100+ trillion objects stored
- Core features: object storage, versioning, lifecycle management
- Multiple storage classes for cost optimization
- Global scale with 99.999999999% durability

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Massive Scale Storage**: How do we store 100+ trillion objects efficiently?
2. **Global Distribution**: How do we distribute objects across multiple regions worldwide?
3. **Data Durability**: How do we achieve 11 9's durability at massive scale?
4. **Cost Optimization**: How do we balance performance with storage costs?
5. **Object Lifecycle**: How do we manage object transitions between storage classes?

The crux is balancing massive scale with high durability while maintaining performance and cost efficiency."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**Storage Scale:**
- 100 trillion objects
- Average object size: 100KB
- Total storage: 100T × 100KB = 10EB (exabytes)
- Daily growth: 1B new objects × 100KB = 100TB/day

**Traffic Scale:**
- Daily requests: 100T objects × 0.1 access rate = 10T requests/day
- Peak requests per second: 10T ÷ 86400 × 5 = 580M requests/second
- Peak factor: 5x for peak hours
- Bandwidth: 580M × 100KB = 58TB/second peak

**Cost Scale:**
- Annual infrastructure: $10B (estimated)
- Cost per GB-month: $10B ÷ (10EB × 12) = $0.00083
- Revenue per GB-month: $0.023 (Standard storage)
- Profit margin: 96% (very high due to scale)

**Durability Requirements:**
- 99.999999999% (11 9's) = 1 object lost per 100 trillion
- With 100T objects, expect 1 object loss every few years
- Need multiple layers of redundancy and error correction

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed system with intelligent redundancy and cost optimization."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Distributed object storage with global distribution
**Storage Strategy**: Multi-tier storage with intelligent lifecycle management
**Durability Strategy**: Multiple layers of redundancy and error correction
**Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling with intelligent partitioning

**Key Design Principles:**
1. **Durability-First**: Ensure 11 9's durability at massive scale
2. **Global Distribution**: Serve objects from locations closest to users
3. **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent tiering and lifecycle management
4. **Infinite Scale**: Design for unlimited growth
