# Design Google Cloud Storage - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design Google Cloud Storage for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Google Cloud scale (exabytes of data) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Object storage, lifecycle management, multi-region, or all of them?
3. **Data Types**: What types of data? Files, images, videos, databases, or mixed data types?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Google Cloud scale and focus on object storage, lifecycle management, multi-region support, and enterprise features."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing Google Cloud Storage at scale with:
- Exabytes of data across multiple regions
- Core features: object storage, lifecycle management, multi-region support
- Multiple data types and enterprise features
- Global scale with 99.99% availability

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Massive Scale**: How do we store and manage exabytes of data across multiple regions?
2. **Data Distribution**: How do we distribute data across regions for availability and performance?
3. **Lifecycle Management**: How do we manage data lifecycle from hot to cold storage automatically?
4. **Consistency Management**: How do we maintain consistency across distributed storage systems?
5. **Enterprise Features**: How do we provide enterprise-grade security, compliance, and access control?
6. **Cost Optimization**: How do we optimize storage costs while maintaining performance?

The crux is balancing massive scale with enterprise features while maintaining global consistency and optimizing costs across multiple storage tiers."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**Storage Scale:**
- Total storage: 10 exabytes (10^19 bytes)
- Daily growth: 100PB new data per day
- Data types: Hot (20%), Warm (30%), Cold (50%)
- Replication factor: 3x replication for availability
- Total managed storage: 10EB × 3 = 30EB total managed

**Request Scale:**
- Total requests: 100 billion requests/day
- Peak requests per second: 100B ÷ 86400 × 10 = 11.6M requests/second
- Peak factor: 10x for peak hours and traffic spikes
- Concurrent requests: 11.6M requests/second

**Performance Scale:**
- Read latency: <100ms for 99.9% of reads
- Write latency: <200ms for 99.9% of writes
- Throughput: 10GB/second per region
- Availability: 99.99% uptime (52 minutes downtime/year)

**Cost Scale:**
- Storage cost: $0.02/GB/month for standard storage
- Total monthly cost: 10EB × $0.02 = $20M/month
- Annual infrastructure: $240M
- Cost per request: $240M / (100B × 400) = $0.006

**Geographic Scale:**
- Regions: 30+ regions worldwide
- Data centers per region: 3+ data centers
- Total data centers: 90+ data centers
- Global coverage: 99.9% of world population within 100ms

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed storage system with intelligent lifecycle management and enterprise features."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Distributed object storage with intelligent lifecycle management
