# Design Monitoring and Alerting System - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design a monitoring and alerting system for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Datadog scale (10M+ metrics/second) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Metrics collection, alerting, visualization, or all of them?
3. **Data Types**: Infrastructure metrics, application metrics, business metrics, or all types?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Datadog scale and focus on the core features: metrics collection, alerting, visualization, and real-time monitoring."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing a monitoring and alerting system at scale with:
- 10M+ metrics/second
- Core features: metrics collection, alerting, visualization, real-time monitoring
- Multiple metric types and sources
- Global scale with sub-second response times

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Metrics Collection**: How do we collect millions of metrics per second from distributed systems?
2. **Data Storage**: How do we store and query massive amounts of time-series data efficiently?
3. **Real-time Processing**: How do we process metrics in real-time for immediate alerting?
4. **Alerting Engine**: How do we generate and manage alerts across thousands of services?
5. **Visualization**: How do we provide real-time dashboards and visualizations?
6. **Scalability**: How do we scale to handle unlimited metrics and services?

The crux is balancing real-time processing with data retention while maintaining alert accuracy and system performance."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**Metrics Scale:**
- Peak metrics: 10M metrics/second
- Average metric size: 100 bytes
- Peak bandwidth: 10M × 100 bytes = 1GB/second
- Daily metrics: 10M × 86400 = 864B metrics/day

**Storage Scale:**
- Raw metrics: 864B × 100 bytes = 86.4TB/day
- Retention period: 1 year = 365 days
- Total storage: 86.4TB × 365 = 31.5PB
- Compressed storage: 31.5PB ÷ 10 = 3.15PB (with compression)

**Processing Scale:**
- Alert rules: 100K+ alert rules
- Alert evaluations: 10M × 100K = 1T evaluations/second
- Dashboard queries: 100K queries/second
- Real-time processing: 10M metrics/second

**Performance Scale:**
- Metric ingestion: <100ms for 95% of metrics
- Alert evaluation: <1 second for 95% of alerts
- Dashboard queries: <200ms for 95% of queries
- Data retention: 1 year with fast access

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed system with real-time processing and intelligent storage."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Real-time metrics processing with intelligent storage
**Metrics Strategy**: Distributed collection with intelligent aggregation
**Alerting Strategy**: Real-time evaluation with intelligent routing
**Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling with intelligent data distribution

**Key Design Principles:**
