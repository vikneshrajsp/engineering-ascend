# Design Rate Limiting System - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design a rate limiting system for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Google Cloud scale (trillions of requests/day) or starting from scratch?
2. **Use Cases**: Which scenarios should I focus on? API protection, DDoS prevention, user abuse prevention, or all of them?
3. **Granularity**: What level of rate limiting? Per user, per IP, per API endpoint, or per service?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Google Cloud scale and focus on API protection, DDoS prevention, and user abuse prevention across multiple services."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing a rate limiting system at scale with:
- Trillions of requests/day across multiple services
- Core use cases: API protection, DDoS prevention, user abuse prevention
- Multiple granularity levels: per user, per IP, per endpoint, per service
- Global scale with sub-millisecond response times

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Request Volume**: How do we process and evaluate trillions of requests per day in real-time?
2. **Rate Calculation**: How do we calculate and maintain rate limits across multiple dimensions?
3. **Decision Making**: How do we make rate limiting decisions in sub-millisecond time?
4. **Multi-dimensional Limits**: How do we handle different rate limit types simultaneously?
5. **Global Distribution**: How do we maintain consistent rate limiting across multiple regions?
6. **State Management**: How do we track and update rate limit state across distributed systems?

The crux is balancing real-time performance with accurate rate limiting while handling massive scale and maintaining consistency across distributed systems."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**Request Scale:**
- Total requests: 1 trillion requests/day
- Peak requests per second: 1T ÷ 86400 × 10 = 115M requests/second
- Peak factor: 10x for peak hours and traffic spikes
- Concurrent rate limit checks: 115M checks/second

**Rate Limit Scale:**
- Services: 1000 different services
- Endpoints per service: 100 endpoints
- Total endpoints: 1000 × 100 = 100K endpoints
- Rate limit rules: 100K × 5 = 500K rate limit rules
- Updates per second: 115M rate limit checks/second

**Performance Scale:**
- Rate limit check: <1ms for 99.9% of checks
- Decision making: <100μs for 99.9% of decisions
- State updates: <10ms for 99.9% of updates
- Global consistency: <100ms for 99.9% of updates

**Storage Scale:**
- Rate limit state: 100M active rate limit counters
- State size per counter: 1KB
- Total state: 100M × 1KB = 100GB
- Daily growth: 10GB/day new state data

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed real-time system with intelligent rate limiting and global consistency."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Distributed rate limiting with intelligent decision making
**Rate Strategy**: Multi-dimensional rate limiting with intelligent caching
**Decision Strategy**: Real-time decision making with intelligent algorithms
**Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling with intelligent request distribution
