# Design Recommendation System - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design a recommendation system for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Netflix scale (200M+ users) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Content recommendations, collaborative filtering, ML models, or all of them?
3. **Content Types**: Movies, products, articles, or general recommendations?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Netflix scale and focus on the core features: content recommendations, collaborative filtering, ML models, and real-time personalization."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing a recommendation system at scale with:
- 200M+ monthly active users
- Core features: content recommendations, collaborative filtering, ML models, real-time personalization
- Multiple content types and user preferences
- Global scale with sub-second recommendation generation

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Recommendation Generation**: How do we generate personalized recommendations for millions of users in real-time?
2. **Data Processing**: How do we process massive amounts of user behavior and content data?
3. **ML Model Training**: How do we train and deploy ML models at scale?
4. **Real-time Updates**: How do we update recommendations based on user behavior in real-time?
5. **Cold Start Problem**: How do we handle new users and new content?
6. **Scalability**: How do we scale to handle billions of recommendation requests?

The crux is balancing recommendation quality with real-time performance while handling massive scale and complex ML workloads."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**User Scale:**
- 200M monthly active users
- Assuming 40% daily active users = 80M DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 80M × 0.1 = 8M concurrent
- Peak factor: 4x for peak hours (evening viewing)

**Content Scale:**
- Total content: 10M+ movies/shows
- User interactions: 80M users × 20 interactions/day = 1.6B interactions/day
- Peak interactions per second: 1.6B ÷ 86400 × 4 = 74K interactions/second
- Content metadata: 10M × 5KB = 50GB metadata

**Recommendation Scale:**
- Recommendations per user: 100 recommendations per request
- Daily recommendation requests: 80M users × 10 requests/day = 800M requests/day
- Peak recommendations per second: 800M × 100 ÷ 86400 × 4 = 3.7M recommendations/second
- Storage for recommendations: 800M × 100 × 1KB = 80TB/day

**ML Scale:**
- Training data: 1.6B interactions/day × 30 days = 48B training samples
- Model updates: Daily model retraining with incremental updates
- Feature vectors: 100M+ features per user/content
- Model size: 10GB+ for complex recommendation models

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed ML system with real-time processing and intelligent caching."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: ML-first microservices with real-time processing
**Recommendation Strategy**: Hybrid approach (collaborative filtering + content-based + deep learning)
**Data Strategy**: Real-time streaming with batch processing for ML training
**Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling with intelligent ML model distribution

**Key Design Principles:**
1. **ML-First**: Design around machine learning workflows
