# Design Gmail - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design Gmail for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Gmail scale (1.5B+ users) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Email storage, spam filtering, search, or all of them?
3. **Integration**: How important is integration with Google's ecosystem (Calendar, Drive, etc.)?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Gmail scale and focus on email storage, spam filtering, search, and real-time synchronization."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing Gmail at scale with:
- 1.5B+ monthly active users
- Core features: email storage, spam filtering, search, real-time sync
- Deep integration with Google's ecosystem
- Global scale with intelligent email processing

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Email Storage**: How do we store and manage petabytes of email data efficiently?
2. **Spam Filtering**: How do we filter spam and malicious emails at scale using ML?
3. **Email Search**: How do we provide fast and relevant email search across petabytes of data?
4. **Real-time Sync**: How do we synchronize emails across multiple devices in real-time?
5. **Email Delivery**: How do we ensure reliable email delivery and receipt?
6. **Security & Privacy**: How do we protect sensitive email data and ensure privacy?

The crux is balancing massive-scale email processing with intelligent filtering while maintaining real-time synchronization and search capabilities across Google's global infrastructure."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**User Scale:**
- Total users: 1.5 billion monthly active users
- Daily active users: 1.5B × 0.7 = 1.05B DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 1.05B × 0.1 = 105M concurrent
- Peak factor: 3x for peak hours (business hours)

**Email Scale:**
- Emails per user per day: 50 emails average (send + receive)
- Total daily emails: 1.05B × 50 = 52.5B emails/day
- Peak emails per second: 52.5B ÷ 86400 × 3 = 1.8M emails/second
- Email size: 10KB average (text + attachments)

**Storage Scale:**
- Daily email storage: 52.5B × 10KB = 525TB/day
- Annual growth: 525TB × 365 = 192PB/year
- Total storage: 1EB+ email data
- Search index: 500PB+ search index

**Performance Scale:**
- Email delivery: <1 second for 99.9% of emails
- Search response: <500ms for 99.9% of searches
- Spam filtering: <100ms for 99.9% of emails
- Real-time sync: <2 seconds for 99.9% of updates

**Search Scale:**
- Search queries per user per day: 20 searches
- Total daily searches: 1.05B × 20 = 21B searches/day
- Peak searches per second: 21B ÷ 86400 × 3 = 730K searches/second

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed email system with intelligent processing and real-time capabilities."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:
