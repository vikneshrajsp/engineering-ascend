# Design Chat System - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design a chat system for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about WhatsApp scale (2B+ users) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Text chat, group chats, media sharing, or all of them?
3. **Platforms**: Mobile apps, web, or both?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with WhatsApp scale and focus on the core features: text chat, group chats, media sharing, and real-time messaging."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing a chat system at scale with:
- 2B+ monthly active users
- Core features: text chat, group chats, media sharing, real-time messaging
- Mobile-first approach with web support
- Global scale with sub-second message delivery

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Real-time Messaging**: How do we deliver messages instantly to millions of users?
2. **Message Persistence**: How do we store and retrieve billions of messages efficiently?
3. **Group Chat Management**: How do we handle group operations and member management?
4. **Media Sharing**: How do we handle photo/video sharing at massive scale?
5. **Presence Management**: How do we track online/offline status of users?
6. **Message Ordering**: How do we ensure message consistency across devices?

The crux is balancing real-time performance with message reliability while handling massive scale and complex group dynamics."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**User Scale:**
- 2B monthly active users
- Assuming 30% daily active users = 600M DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 600M × 0.1 = 60M concurrent
- Peak factor: 3x for peak hours

**Message Scale:**
- Average user sends 50 messages/day = 30B messages/day
- Peak messages per second: 30B ÷ 86400 × 3 = 1M messages/second
- Group chats: 20% of messages = 200K group messages/second
- Media messages: 10% of messages = 100K media messages/second

**Storage Scale:**
- Average message size: 100 bytes (text) + 1KB metadata = 1.1KB
- Daily storage: 30B × 1.1KB = 33TB/day
- Media storage: 100K × 5MB = 500TB/day media
- Total daily storage: 533TB/day

**Network Scale:**
- Peak bandwidth: 1M messages × 1.1KB = 1.1GB/second
- Media bandwidth: 100K × 5MB = 500GB/second
- Total peak bandwidth: 501.1GB/second

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed real-time system with intelligent message routing and efficient storage."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Real-time messaging with distributed storage
**Message Strategy**: WebSocket connections with message queuing
**Storage Strategy**: Hybrid storage (hot data in memory, warm in SSD, cold in object storage)
**Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling with intelligent partitioning

**Key Design Principles:**
1. **Real-time First**: Prioritize instant message delivery
