# Design Telemedicine Platform - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design a telemedicine platform for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Teladoc scale (50M+ users) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Video consultations, patient management, prescription management, or all of them?
3. **Compliance**: How important is HIPAA compliance and medical regulations?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Teladoc scale and focus on video consultations, patient management, prescription management, and HIPAA compliance."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing a telemedicine platform at scale with:
- 50M+ monthly active users
- Core features: video consultations, patient management, prescription management
- HIPAA compliance and medical regulations
- Global scale with secure healthcare data

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Video Consultations**: How do we provide high-quality video consultations to millions of users simultaneously?
2. **HIPAA Compliance**: How do we ensure complete HIPAA compliance for all healthcare data?
3. **Patient Management**: How do we manage patient records and medical history securely?
4. **Prescription Management**: How do we handle prescription generation and management safely?
5. **Real-time Communication**: How do we enable real-time doctor-patient communication?
6. **Data Security**: How do we protect sensitive medical information from breaches?

The crux is balancing healthcare service delivery with strict compliance requirements while maintaining performance and security for millions of users."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**User Scale:**
- Total users: 50 million monthly active users
- Daily active users: 50M × 0.2 = 10M DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 10M × 0.1 = 1M concurrent
- Peak factor: 3x for peak hours (business hours)

**Consultation Scale:**
- Consultations per user per month: 2 consultations average
- Total monthly consultations: 50M × 2 = 100M consultations/month
- Daily consultations: 100M ÷ 30 = 3.3M consultations/day
- Peak consultations per second: 3.3M ÷ 86400 × 3 = 115 consultations/second

**Video Scale:**
- Video quality: 720p to 1080p
- Bandwidth per consultation: 1Mbps to 5Mbps
- Peak bandwidth: 115 × 3Mbps = 345Mbps
- Total daily bandwidth: 3.3M × 3Mbps × 30 minutes = 5TB/day

**Performance Scale:**
- Video latency: <150ms for 99.9% of consultations
- Consultation start: <10 seconds for 99.9% of consultations
- Data access: <500ms for 99.9% of patient data
- HIPAA compliance: 100% compliance requirement

**Storage Scale:**
- Patient records: 50M patients × 10MB = 500TB
- Video recordings: 3.3M × 100MB = 330TB/day
- Medical images: 3.3M × 5MB = 16.5TB/day
- Total storage: 1PB+ healthcare data

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed healthcare platform with strict compliance and real-time video capabilities."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Distributed healthcare platform with strict compliance
