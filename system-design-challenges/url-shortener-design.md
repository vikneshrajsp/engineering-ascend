# Design URL Shortener - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design a URL shortener for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Bitly scale (100M+ users) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? URL shortening, analytics, custom URLs, or all of them?
3. **Platforms**: Web service, mobile apps, or both?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Bitly scale and focus on the core features: URL shortening, analytics, custom URLs, and click tracking."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing a URL shortener at scale with:
- 100M+ monthly active users
- Core features: URL shortening, analytics, custom URLs, click tracking
- Web service with API support
- Global scale with sub-second response times

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **URL Generation**: How do we generate unique, short URLs for millions of long URLs?
2. **Click Tracking**: How do we track billions of clicks efficiently and in real-time?
3. **Analytics**: How do we provide detailed analytics for URL performance?
4. **Custom URLs**: How do we handle custom URL requests and conflicts?
5. **High Availability**: How do we ensure the service is always available for redirects?
6. **Scalability**: How do we scale to handle millions of URL generations and redirects?

The crux is balancing URL generation speed with analytics accuracy while maintaining high availability for redirects."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**User Scale:**
- 100M monthly active users
- Assuming 20% daily active users = 20M DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 20M × 0.1 = 2M concurrent
- Peak factor: 3x for peak hours

**URL Scale:**
- Average user creates 5 URLs/day = 100M URLs/day
- Peak URL creation per second: 100M ÷ 86400 × 3 = 3.5K URLs/second
- Total URLs stored: 100M × 365 = 36.5B URLs
- URL storage: 36.5B × 200 bytes = 7.3TB storage

**Click Scale:**
- Average URL gets 100 clicks/day = 10B clicks/day
- Peak clicks per second: 10B ÷ 86400 × 3 = 350K clicks/second
- Click storage: 10B × 100 bytes = 1TB/day
- Analytics storage: 10B × 500 bytes = 5TB/day

**Performance Scale:**
- URL generation: 3.5K/second
- URL redirects: 350K/second
- Analytics queries: 50K/second
- Peak bandwidth: 350K × 1KB = 350MB/second

These numbers tell me we need a high-performance system with efficient storage and real-time analytics."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: High-performance microservices with read-heavy optimization
**URL Strategy**: Distributed ID generation with base62 encoding
**Storage Strategy**: Hybrid storage (hot data in memory, warm in SSD, cold in object storage)
**Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling with intelligent caching

**Key Design Principles:**
1. **Performance First**: Optimize for fast URL generation and redirects
