# Design Google Maps - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design Google Maps for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Google Maps scale (1B+ users) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Map display, navigation, traffic, location search, or all of them?
3. **Data Types**: What types of data? Static maps, real-time traffic, POI data, or mixed data types?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Google Maps scale and focus on the core features: map display, navigation, real-time traffic, and location search."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing Google Maps at scale with:
- 1B+ monthly active users
- Core features: map display, navigation, real-time traffic, location search
- Multiple data types: static maps, real-time data, POI data, geospatial data
- Global scale with sub-second response times

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Map Rendering**: How do we render and serve maps to billions of users in real-time?
2. **Geospatial Data**: How do we store and process petabytes of geospatial data efficiently?
3. **Real-time Traffic**: How do we collect, process, and serve real-time traffic data?
4. **Navigation Engine**: How do we calculate optimal routes for millions of users simultaneously?
5. **Global Distribution**: How do we serve maps and data from locations closest to users?
6. **Data Freshness**: How do we keep maps and traffic data current across the globe?

The crux is balancing real-time performance with massive geospatial data processing while maintaining global coverage and sub-second response times."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**User Scale:**
- Total users: 1 billion monthly active users
- Daily active users: 1B × 0.3 = 300M DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 300M × 0.1 = 30M concurrent
- Peak factor: 5x for peak hours and traffic spikes

**Map Scale:**
- Map tiles per request: 9 tiles per view (3x3 grid)
- Peak map requests per second: 30M × 5 × 9 = 1.35B tiles/second
- Map tile size: 10KB average
- Peak bandwidth: 1.35B × 10KB = 13.5TB/second

**Navigation Scale:**
- Daily navigation sessions: 100M sessions
- Peak navigation requests per second: 100M ÷ 86400 × 5 = 5.8K requests/second
- Route calculation time: <500ms target
- Concurrent route calculations: 5.8K × 0.5 = 2.9K concurrent

**Data Scale:**
- Geospatial data: 100PB total
- Daily traffic data: 1PB new data per day
- POI data: 200M+ points of interest
- Map tiles: 10^15 total tiles (zoom levels 0-20)

**Performance Scale:**
- Map tile response: <200ms for 99.9% of requests
- Route calculation: <500ms for 99.9% of requests
- Traffic updates: <1 second for 99.9% of updates
- Global consistency: <100ms for 99.9% of updates

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed geospatial system with intelligent caching and real-time data processing."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Distributed geospatial system with intelligent caching
**Map Strategy**: Multi-level tile caching with intelligent distribution
**Data Strategy**: Real-time geospatial data processing with intelligent storage
**Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling with intelligent geographic distribution

**Key Design Principles:**
