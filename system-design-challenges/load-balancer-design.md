# Design Load Balancer - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design a load balancer for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about AWS ALB scale (1M+ requests/second) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Traffic distribution, health checking, SSL termination, or all of them?
3. **Protocols**: HTTP/HTTPS, TCP, UDP, or all protocols?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with AWS ALB scale and focus on the core features: traffic distribution, health checking, SSL termination, and auto-scaling."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing a load balancer at scale with:
- 1M+ requests/second
- Core features: traffic distribution, health checking, SSL termination, auto-scaling
- HTTP/HTTPS and TCP protocols
- Global scale with sub-millisecond response times

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Traffic Distribution**: How do we distribute millions of requests per second efficiently?
2. **Health Checking**: How do we monitor backend health and remove unhealthy instances?
3. **SSL Termination**: How do we handle SSL/TLS termination at massive scale?
4. **Auto-scaling**: How do we automatically scale backend instances based on demand?
5. **High Availability**: How do we ensure the load balancer itself is always available?
6. **Performance**: How do we maintain sub-millisecond latency at massive scale?

The crux is balancing traffic distribution efficiency with health monitoring and auto-scaling while maintaining high availability and performance."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**Traffic Scale:**
- Peak requests: 1M requests/second
- Average request size: 2KB
- Peak bandwidth: 1M × 2KB = 2GB/second
- Daily traffic: 1M × 86400 = 86.4B requests/day

**Backend Scale:**
- Backend instances: 1000+ instances
- Instances per request: 1 instance per request
- Health checks: 1000 instances × 1 check/30s = 33 health checks/second
- Connection management: 1M active connections

**Performance Scale:**
- Latency requirement: <1ms for 95% of requests
- Throughput: 1M requests/second
- Concurrent connections: 1M × 10 = 10M concurrent connections
- Memory per connection: 1KB = 10GB total memory

**SSL Scale:**
- SSL connections: 80% HTTPS = 800K SSL connections/second
- SSL termination: 800K × 2KB = 1.6GB/second SSL processing
- Certificate management: 1000+ SSL certificates
- Key rotation: Daily key rotation for security

These numbers tell me we need a high-performance system with efficient connection management and intelligent health monitoring."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Distributed load balancing with intelligent routing
**Traffic Strategy**: Multiple algorithms with health-aware distribution
**Scaling Strategy**: Auto-scaling with intelligent instance management
**Availability Strategy**: Multi-region deployment with automatic failover

**Key Design Principles:**
1. **Performance First**: Optimize for sub-millisecond latency
