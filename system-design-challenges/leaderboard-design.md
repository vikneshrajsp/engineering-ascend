# Design Leaderboard System - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design a leaderboard system for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Fortnite scale (100M+ users) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Score tracking, ranking, real-time updates, or all of them?
3. **Game Types**: Single game, multiple games, or general leaderboards?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Fortnite scale and focus on the core features: score tracking, ranking, real-time updates, and multiple game modes."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing a leaderboard system at scale with:
- 100M+ monthly active users
- Core features: score tracking, ranking, real-time updates, multiple game modes
- Multiple games and competition types
- Global scale with sub-second response times

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Score Tracking**: How do we track and update scores for millions of users in real-time?
2. **Ranking Calculation**: How do we calculate and maintain rankings across multiple game modes?
3. **Real-time Updates**: How do we provide real-time leaderboard updates to millions of users?
4. **Multi-game Support**: How do we handle different games with different scoring systems?
5. **Anti-cheat**: How do we prevent score manipulation and cheating?
6. **Scalability**: How do we scale to handle unlimited users and games?

The crux is balancing real-time performance with ranking accuracy while handling massive scale and preventing cheating."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**User Scale:**
- 100M monthly active users
- Assuming 30% daily active users = 30M DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 30M × 0.1 = 3M concurrent
- Peak factor: 4x for peak hours (evening gaming)

**Game Scale:**
- Average user plays 3 games/day = 90M games/day
- Peak games per second: 90M ÷ 86400 × 4 = 4.2K games/second
- Score updates per game: 100 score events per game
- Peak score updates per second: 4.2K × 100 = 420K updates/second

**Leaderboard Scale:**
- Game modes: 10 different game modes
- Leaderboards per mode: Top 1000 players
- Total leaderboard entries: 10 × 1000 = 10K entries
- Updates per second: 420K score updates/second

**Performance Scale:**
- Score update: <100ms for 95% of updates
- Ranking calculation: <1 second for 95% of calculations
- Leaderboard query: <200ms for 95% of queries
- Real-time updates: <500ms for 95% of updates

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed real-time system with intelligent ranking and anti-cheat mechanisms."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Real-time score processing with intelligent ranking
**Score Strategy**: Distributed score tracking with validation and anti-cheat
**Ranking Strategy**: Real-time ranking calculation with intelligent caching
**Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling with intelligent game distribution

**Key Design Principles:**
1. **Real-time First**: Prioritize immediate score updates and ranking
