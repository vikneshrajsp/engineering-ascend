# Design Uber - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design Uber for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Uber's current scale (100M+ users) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Ride booking, driver matching, real-time tracking, or all of them?
3. **Geographic Scope**: Single city, multiple cities, or global scale?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Uber's current scale and focus on the core features: ride booking, driver matching, real-time tracking, and payment processing."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing Uber at scale with:
- 100M+ global users
- Core features: ride booking, driver matching, real-time tracking, payments
- Global scale with sub-second response times
- Real-time location services and dynamic pricing

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Real-time Location Services**: How do we track millions of drivers and riders in real-time?
2. **Driver-Rider Matching**: How do we efficiently match riders with nearby drivers?
3. **Dynamic Pricing**: How do we calculate real-time pricing based on demand and supply?
4. **Payment Processing**: How do we handle secure payments and fraud detection?
5. **Geospatial Processing**: How do we process location data and calculate optimal routes?

The crux is balancing real-time performance with global scale while maintaining reliability and security."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**User Scale:**
- 100M global users
- Assuming 20% daily active users = 20M DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 20M × 0.1 = 2M concurrent
- Active drivers: 20M × 0.05 = 1M active drivers

**Ride Scale:**
- Average rides per user per day: 0.5
- Total daily rides: 20M × 0.5 = 10M rides/day
- Peak rides per hour: 10M ÷ 24 × 2 = 833K rides/hour
- Peak rides per second: 833K ÷ 3600 = 231 rides/second

**Location Updates:**
- Driver location updates: 1M drivers × 10 updates/minute = 10M updates/minute
- Rider location updates: 20M users × 2 updates/minute = 40M updates/minute
- Total location updates: 50M updates/minute = 833K updates/second

**Data Scale:**
- Location data per update: 100 bytes (lat, lng, timestamp, user_id)
- Daily location data: 50M × 24 × 60 × 100 bytes = 7.2TB/day
- Annual location data: 7.2TB × 365 = 2.6PB/year

These numbers tell me we need a real-time geospatial system with massive throughput and low latency."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Event-driven microservices with real-time processing
**Geospatial Strategy**: Spatial indexing with real-time location updates
**Matching Strategy**: Real-time driver-rider matching with optimization algorithms
**Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling with geographic partitioning

**Key Design Principles:**
1. **Real-time First**: Prioritize real-time performance and low latency
2. **Geographic Distribution**: Process data close to where it's generated
3. **Event-Driven**: Use events for real-time updates and notifications
4. **Intelligent Matching**: Optimize driver-rider matching for efficiency
