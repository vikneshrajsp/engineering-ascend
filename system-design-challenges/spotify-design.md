# Design Spotify - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design Spotify for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Spotify scale (500M+ users) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Music streaming, playlist management, recommendations, or all of them?
3. **Platform Support**: How important is cross-platform support (mobile, web, desktop, smart speakers)?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Spotify scale and focus on music streaming, playlist management, and recommendation systems."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing Spotify at scale with:
- 500M+ monthly active users
- Core features: music streaming, playlist management, recommendation systems
- Cross-platform support across multiple devices and platforms
- Global scale with intelligent music discovery

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Music Streaming**: How do we stream high-quality audio to hundreds of millions of users simultaneously?
2. **Playlist Management**: How do we manage billions of playlists with real-time collaboration?
3. **Recommendation Engine**: How do we provide personalized music recommendations at scale?
4. **Cross-platform Sync**: How do we synchronize user state across multiple devices and platforms?
5. **Content Discovery**: How do we help users discover new music and artists?
6. **Social Features**: How do we enable social sharing and collaborative playlists?

The crux is balancing massive-scale music streaming with intelligent personalization while maintaining cross-platform consistency and social collaboration features."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**User Scale:**
- Total users: 500 million monthly active users
- Daily active users: 500M × 0.35 = 175M DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 175M × 0.12 = 21M concurrent
- Peak factor: 4x for peak hours (evening listening)

**Streaming Scale:**
- Average session length: 2.5 hours per user per day
- Total streaming hours: 175M × 2.5 = 437.5M hours/day
- Peak streams per second: 437.5M ÷ 86400 × 4 = 20.3K streams/second
- Audio quality: 128kbps (free), 320kbps (premium)

**Playlist Scale:**
- Playlists per user: 50 playlists average
- Total playlists: 500M × 50 = 25 billion playlists
- Daily playlist updates: 100M updates/day
- Collaborative playlists: 10% of all playlists

**Recommendation Scale:**
- Daily recommendation requests: 500M × 10 = 5B requests/day
- Peak recommendations per second: 5B ÷ 86400 × 4 = 231K requests/second
- Model training: Daily retraining with 500M+ user interactions

**Performance Scale:**
- Stream start: <3 seconds for 99.9% of streams
- Audio quality: 128kbps to 320kbps adaptive
- Playlist sync: <1 second for 99.9% of updates
- Recommendation response: <500ms for 99.9% of requests

**Storage Scale:**
- Music library: 100 million songs
- User data: 500M users × 1MB = 500TB
- Playlist data: 25B playlists × 10KB = 250TB
- Total storage: 1PB+ user data and metadata

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed music streaming system with intelligent recommendations and real-time collaboration."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Distributed music streaming with intelligent recommendations
