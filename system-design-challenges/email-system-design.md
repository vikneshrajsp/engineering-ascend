# Design Email System - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design an email system for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Gmail scale (1.5B+ users) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Email sending/receiving, storage, search, or all of them?
3. **Platforms**: Web, mobile apps, or both?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Gmail scale and focus on the core features: email sending/receiving, storage, search, and spam filtering."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing an email system at scale with:
- 1.5B+ monthly active users
- Core features: email sending/receiving, storage, search, spam filtering
- Web and mobile platforms
- Global scale with sub-second response times

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Email Delivery**: How do we deliver billions of emails reliably and quickly?
2. **Email Storage**: How do we store and retrieve trillions of emails efficiently?
3. **Email Search**: How do we provide fast search across massive email archives?
4. **Spam Filtering**: How do we detect and filter spam while maintaining delivery?
5. **Real-time Sync**: How do we sync emails across multiple devices in real-time?
6. **Scalability**: How do we scale to handle unlimited email growth?

The crux is balancing email delivery reliability with storage efficiency and search performance while maintaining spam protection and real-time synchronization."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**User Scale:**
- 1.5B monthly active users
- Assuming 40% daily active users = 600M DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 600M × 0.1 = 60M concurrent
- Peak factor: 4x for peak hours

**Email Scale:**
- Average user sends 5 emails/day = 3B emails sent/day
- Average user receives 20 emails/day = 12B emails received/day
- Total emails per day: 15B emails/day
- Peak emails per second: 15B ÷ 86400 × 4 = 694K emails/second

**Storage Scale:**
- Average email size: 10KB (text) + 50KB (attachments) = 60KB
- Daily storage: 15B × 60KB = 900TB/day
- Annual storage: 900TB × 400 = 360PB/year
- Total storage: 5 years × 360PB = 1.8EB

**Performance Scale:**
- Email delivery: <1 second for 95% of emails
- Email search: <200ms for 95% of searches
- Real-time sync: <100ms for 95% of updates
- Spam filtering: <500ms for 95% of emails

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed system with efficient storage and real-time processing."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**

**My Response**: "Based on the scale, here's my high-level approach:

**Architecture Pattern**: Distributed email processing with intelligent storage
**Email Strategy**: Reliable delivery with spam filtering and real-time sync
**Storage Strategy**: Hybrid storage with intelligent tiering and compression
**Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling with intelligent partitioning

**Key Design Principles:**
