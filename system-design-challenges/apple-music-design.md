# Design Apple Music - System Design Challenge

*Complete interview walkthrough showing the thought process from requirement clarification to detailed solution design, following the RESHADED framework.*

## 🎯 **Interview Walkthrough**

### **Step 1: Requirement Clarification & Scoping**

**Interviewer**: "Design Apple Music for me."

**My Response**: "Great! Before I start designing, I need to understand the scope and requirements better. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. **Scale**: Are we talking about Apple Music scale (100M+ users) or starting from scratch?
2. **Features**: Which core features should I focus on? Music streaming, Siri integration, spatial audio, or all of them?
3. **Ecosystem**: How important is integration with Apple's ecosystem (iPhone, iPad, Mac, HomePod)?
4. **Constraints**: Any specific performance, cost, or technical constraints I should consider?"

**Interviewer**: "Let's start with Apple Music scale and focus on music streaming, Siri integration, spatial audio, and ecosystem integration."

**My Response**: "Perfect! So I'm designing Apple Music at scale with:
- 100M+ monthly active users
- Core features: music streaming, Siri integration, spatial audio, ecosystem integration
- Deep integration with Apple's hardware and software ecosystem
- Global scale with high-quality audio streaming

Let me start by identifying the core problems we need to solve."

### **Step 2: Identifying Core Problems**

**My Thought Process**: "From the requirements, I can identify several core problems:

1. **Music Streaming**: How do we stream high-quality audio to millions of users simultaneously?
2. **Siri Integration**: How do we integrate with Siri for voice-controlled music playback?
3. **Spatial Audio**: How do we process and deliver immersive spatial audio experiences?
4. **Ecosystem Integration**: How do we seamlessly integrate across Apple's hardware and software?
5. **Content Management**: How do we manage a massive music library with rights and licensing?
6. **Personalization**: How do we provide personalized music recommendations?

The crux is balancing high-quality audio streaming with deep ecosystem integration while maintaining performance and personalization across Apple's diverse hardware platform."

### **Step 3: Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation**

**My Response**: "Let me do some quick calculations to understand the scale:

**User Scale:**
- Total users: 100 million monthly active users
- Daily active users: 100M × 0.4 = 40M DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 40M × 0.15 = 6M concurrent
- Peak factor: 3x for peak hours (evening listening)

**Streaming Scale:**
- Average session length: 2 hours per user per day
- Total streaming hours: 40M × 2 = 80M hours/day
- Peak streams per second: 80M ÷ 86400 × 3 = 2.8K streams/second
- Audio quality: 256kbps AAC for standard, 1.5Mbps for lossless

**Bandwidth Scale:**
- Peak bandwidth: 2.8K × 256kbps = 700Mbps for standard quality
- Lossless bandwidth: 2.8K × 1.5Mbps = 4.2Gbps for lossless
- Total daily bandwidth: 80M × 256kbps × 2 = 40TB/day

**Storage Scale:**
- Music library: 100 million songs
- Average song size: 10MB (256kbps, 5 minutes)
- Total library size: 100M × 10MB = 1PB
- Daily new content: 1000 new songs × 10MB = 10GB/day

**Performance Scale:**
- Stream start: <2 seconds for 99.9% of streams
- Audio quality: 256kbps to 1.5Mbps adaptive
- Spatial audio: <100ms processing latency
- Siri response: <500ms for 99.9% of requests

These numbers tell me we need a massively distributed music streaming system with intelligent audio processing and ecosystem integration."

### **Step 4: High-Level Approach**
