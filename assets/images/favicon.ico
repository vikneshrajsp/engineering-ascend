# Favicon Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the favicon.ico file.

To add a proper favicon:
1. Create a 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 pixel icon
2. Save it as favicon.ico in this directory
3. Or use a favicon generator service

Recommended: Use a simple "EA" (Engineering Ascend) design with your brand colors.
